HAIDA TEXTS -MASSET DIALECT.
RECORDED AND EDITED BY JOHN R. SWANTON.

4

INTRODUCTION.
The following texts are about half of those obtained by me in the winter and spring of io900-OI. They are in that form of the Haida language spoken at Masset, on the northern coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and, with little alteration, by the natives of three Alaskan towns, - tiowkan, Klinkwan, and Kasaan. The rest of my texts were taken down in the Skidegate dialect, which is now confined to the town of that name, situated about midway of the archipelago. The speakers of Masset, B. C. number in the neighborhood of 6oo, about evenly divided between Masset and Alaska; the speakers of Skidegate, 2 5O. Although greater in number, and, if anything, more satisfactory from the point of view of linguistics, than those taken at Skidegate, these texts are less gratifying from a purely ethnological standpoint, being shorter and also showing more evidences of missionary influence, though this latter fact may be due as much to my interpreters as to the story-tellers themselves. This influence does not so much operate to introduce foreign elements as to reduce the length of the stories and deprive them of some of their old significance. There also appears to be less respect for myths among Masset than among Skidegate people, and when this happens more liberties are certain to be taken with them. The most trustworthy stories were obtained from an old man named Walter, who belonged to the Rear-Town-People of Yan. He contributed part of Story T, and Stories 3, 4, I0, I4, I5, I7, i8, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 3I, 33, 34, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 5I, 53, 55, 57, 58, 63, 65, 70, 72, 73, 87, 88, 89. One section of the Raven Story and the shorter of the two stories about the Copper Salmon (No. 74), were contributed by a none too intelligent old man of the Cod-People. Part of Story i, and Stories
2, 13, I6, 19, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, III, 20, 2I, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 39, 40, 52,

54, 56, 59, 62, 66, 67, 68, 76, 78, 8o, 8i, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, were told by Isaac, an old man of Those-born-at-LI'MlAn. So far as they go, they are fairly trustworthy, but many of them he evidently knew only in a very sketchy way. Stories 2, 35, 36, 41, 47, 6o, 6i, 7I, 75, 79, were related by Philip KihLai'ga, a young man of the Cod-People. Some of these are good; but his desire for pecuniary compensation was so strong as to induce him to extend the details of several, notably so No. 6o, to a wearisome and altogether unnecessary length. The remaining myths, Nos. 64, 69, 77, with the last section of Story i, were contributed by Richard, one of the West-Coast-Gi'tAns. He is not an old man, and one of my principal reasons for consulting him was, that he is the sole survivor of his family in Masset. His contribution

INTRODUCTION.

to the Raven Story consists of an unnecessary elaboration of two of its commonest episodes, but the substance of most of the others is good. He is, or was, the leader of the Church Army at Masset, and has acquired a fondness for extended descriptions and explanations and for a rather involved method of expression. Since I obtained the above texts directly from him, the Haida that they present is not to be taken as that normal to the language. My interpreters were Mary Ridley of the Point-Town-People and Henry Edensaw of the Middle-Town-People, whose father was chief of the StA'stas. Abstracts of these traditions were published in my book, "Contributions to the Ethnology of the Haida" (Vol. V, Part I, of this series).

THE WOMEN OF SRA'LDAN-KUN.

When the Up-Inlet-GitAns' lived at Point-S8a'ldAni-Town," ten women wanted to go after things useful (cedar-bark, etc.). One, named Womanthought-Much-of, called themn first. After she had got through calling them, their parents did not want them to go. They told their parents that she called them. Then ten started in a canoe. And there was a certain foolish boy. After all were in the canoe, they called to him. And his uncle was unwilling to let him go, for he was foolish. All that time they waited for him. Then one of the women got off to call him. It was Woman-thought-Much-of who called him. "Now go with them," said his uncle to him. Then his uncle brought him a stone axe with which to get firewood for them. "Do not chop branches with the stone axe," said

After they had completed the house, this child began to get firewood while they went after their things. "Make a fire for us," they said to him. His uncle had given him the thing with which they used to make fire.4 Then he made a big fire for them. But at that time the sun was always shining. "After you have made a fire,

A small tree stood near by. But a big tree stood over the house. Then evening came. It was summer. While the sun was still high, they came to him. Then he was sitting under the small tree. There was not a cloud to be seen anywhere. "Have you eaten anything?" said they to him. "Yes," he said. He had not eaten. In saying this he lied to them. And having told him to eat dried food, they had set it aside for him. It was still there. Every time they came back, they laughed at him about eating, Every time they laughed at him very much. All of them came back --in the evening. They placed themselves around the fire. At that time he was lying against the tree. Then they joked over him. "Are you still fasting for us?" they said to him.

a long time after the others spoke to him. Those who returned first said, "He says he eats things." Then some of them began to make fun of him. "Did you break the edge of the stone axe?" they said to him. "No," he said. All the time they were making fun of him, they kept saying, "Lie with me." Then he did not speak to them. And he did not laugh at them. He acted in that way because he was foolish. At that time there were still no clouds to be seen anywhere. After they were through eating, they sat about for nothing but to make fun of him because he was their father's nephew. He was not old enough to lie with women. They were only making fun of him. While the weather was still good, something dropped upon them from the tree. And evening came. Then they went to bed. Then there was much rain there. They were very cold.

Then still another got up. She also started off. Another one got up. The boy was looking at them. He did not speak to them. Then all of them got up. And all of them started for the woods. The child they laughed at became supernatural. Then this child pushed the canoe out. All of them wore marten-skin blankets.' They left these right there. But this child did not take them into the canoe. Then he started away. He reached the town. And all went down to meet him. They pulled his canoe up. "But where are the women who went to get things?" said they to him. "Do not ask me," he said. Then he walked up with them. They held him by both shoulders. They were leading him. But then they questioned him. "What became of all of them?"

And the two canoes arrived in front of the place. Now all got off in front of the place. "Where did they (the women) make a fire?" they asked the boy. "Under that tree standing there," he said. And all of them went thither. The mats they (the women) had hung above themselves for a house still lay'there. All of their blankets were under it. Then they took away the blankets their daughters had worn. These were not very wet. They were dry. "Now let us hunt about in the woods," said they to one another. "Where did they go up?" said they to this boy. "Go straight up, opposite where this tree stands," said he. And they saw their (the women's) footprints.

When they had almost arrived, they threw themselves into the sea. And, after all of the women had assembled in one place, they wept. Then all of the people of the town went into one house. They wept much. Then they stopped weeping. Now they were still lying there. "Pray, eat something, for you have fasted for a long time," said [the town people]. Then two of them put salmon near the fire. They softened the dry food. Then they put trays by them. And they put the food irnto the trays. And they put the food in front of them. At that time they remembered this child. They had forgotten about him. Then his uncle questioned them. 'We told him to sit near the fire. He, too, started away from it. When we came back, he was not to be seen there" they recounted to his uncle. Then his uncle's mind was very sick. And he bowed his head. Then he raised his head. "It is well," said he. He said, "It is well for him to go after his uncle's children." The end.

How Shining-Heavens caused Himself to be born.' She was a chief's daughter at Dju.° Her father had a slave he owned watch her continually. Then she said to the slave, "Tell So-and-So that I say that I am in love with him." And next day, when she went out [to defecate] she asked the slave if he had told him. Then he (the slave) said to the chief's daughter, "He said he is afraid of your father." He had not told him, and lied. She told the slave to tell another that she was in love with him, and again he did not tell him. He told her that he (the nephew) feared her father. After she had tried in vain to get [one of] her father's ten nephews,3

she went with the slave. And her father discovered it. Then they abandoned her. Only the wife of the youngest uncle left food for her. Then she went down on the beach to dig shell-fish. After she had done this for a while, she dug out a cockle-shell in which a child cried. Then she looked into it. A small child was in it. And she took it to the house. She put something soft around it, and, although she did not nurse it, it grew up fast. Soon it began creeping. Not long afterward it began walking about. Not long after that, the child said, "See, mother, like this." He made the motion of drawing a bowstring.' After he had said so again, she discovered what he meant. Then she hammered out one of her copper bracelets into a bow, and another into arrows. After she was through, she gave it to him along with the two arrows. He was pleased with them.

Then he went out hunting for birds. When he came back, he brought his mother a cormorant. His mother ate it. The day after, he went out to shoot birds again. He brought his mother a goose. His mother ate it. Next day he went shooting birds again. He brought in a wren. Then he skinned it. He dried the skin. He valued it. And next day he brought in a red-winged blackbird.' That he also skiftned. He also dried it. And next day he brought in a blue-jay. He skinned it, and he dried the skin. The day after, he brought in a woodpecker. He skinned it. He dried the skin. One night he heard some one talking to his mother. A creaking also went on in the house. And at daybreak he awoke in a good house. The carvings on the house-posts were so good that they seemed to wink their eyes. Master-Carpenter 2 had caused himself to become a father to him. He got up, and his father said to the child, "Chief, my child, come and let me dress

One day he asked his father to go fishing. "We will pull out Devil-Fishfished-for.' And on their way to fish they pulled it out. Then they stopped in House-Fishing-Ground. He seated his father in the bow. After he had looked at the rising sun for a while, he said, "Now, father, say, 'The chief of them has it in mind to bite.'" His father said so. "Father, say, 'Comingacross-and-around-the-Island thinks he will bite.'" And so he said. "Father, say, 'The shadows increase upon Rising-steeply. Hasten, chief.'" And he said so. "Father, say, 'The great one coming up against the current begins to think of biting.'" So he said. "Father, say, 'The big one who comes along taking pebbles into his mouth thinks of biting.'"

Quickly it pulled him around this island. He (Shining-Heavens) struck the edges of the canoe with his hands. "Greatest-Carpenter made you. Hold yourself up," said he to it. The thing pulled them to the fishing-ground. A second time it pulled them around the island. Now, when it stopped, he tried to pull the line in. Lo! he pulled the most wonderful creature out head first. In the seaweed about its lips, halibutnests were piled close together. He began taking the halibut into the canoe. After his canoe was full, he pulled out the weather-boards.' After he had taken them (halibut) in a while longer, his canoe was filled, and he let it go..

Then he started' off. He brought the halibut to his wife, and his wife dried them. Then he (Master-Carpenter) called his son again. And after he had painted him up, he said to him, "Now, chief, my son, go and see your uncles who are living yonder." Then he set out. He came to the end of the town and sat there. After he had sat there for a while, they discovered him. They came running to him in a crowd. Then they knew who he was. And they moved over again to where his mother lived. After they had lived there for a while, he went out wearing his wren-skin. "Mother, look at me,' he said. Then his mother went out after him. His mother saw him sitting over the ocean as a piled-up cumulus-cloud. Then he came in and questioned his mother. "Did I look well?" "Yes, chief, my son, you looked well."

And in the evening she called her youngest uncle. And she said to him, "When they go fishing to-morrow, wear a new hat, and carry a new paddle." Next day very early they went fishing. Then she sat down at the end of the town with her knees together. And when she pulled up her dress, the wind, blew out of the inlet. As she raised it higher and higher, the wind increased. When she had it even with her knees' the wind blew out strongly.

Ye'r (Raven).'

(Told by Wailer.)
Not long ago no land was to be seen. Then there was a little thing on the And ocean. This was all open sea. Raven sat upon this. He said, "Become dust." And it became earth. Then it increased. And he divided it. And he put this earth into the water on each side of him. This earth he made small, but he made the one on the other side large. Because he made this earth small, this island ' is small. So he finished this country. (Told

I This is the most widespread, the most popular, and consequently the oftenest recorded, of all tales of the northwest coast north of the Skeena River. Much more connected, and apparently much more correct, versions of this story, may be found on pp. I io et seq. of my "Haida Texts and Myths" Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of Ethnology, the first of which was recorded by me in the Skidegate dialect, while the second was probably originally from Skidegate also. Still I do not feel certain whether the numerous variations shown in the stories I obtained at Masset are due more to ignorance or to regional changes in the story itself. For one thing it must be remembered, that, along the northern coast of Graham Island, Tlingit influence has been very powerful, so much so, that Haida mythology in this district seems to have been in a condition midway between that of the Tlingit and that of the true Haida at Skidegate. This has probably been due in large measure, within the last hundred and fifty years, to the emigration of so many Haida families to southern Alaska, and to the consequent frequent intermarriages with the Tlingit. At any rate, a Masset Haida seems to be almost as much at home in the archipelago of southern Alaska as in his own country, and tells Tlingit stories with almost as much freedom has his own. Of the six texts obtained by me at Masset, the first artd fourth, which were told by an old man named Walter, belonging to the Rear-Town-People, seem the most satisfactory and the most trustworthy; the fifth, told by Peter, an old man belonging to the Cod-People, is also reliable, although the informant was far less intelligent than the preceding. The second and third are from Isaac, one of Those-born-at-LT'elAii, and they faithfully represent his understanding of the story. Many portions of them, however, seem like garbled versions of the Skidegate tale. The sixth was from the leader of the Church Army at Masset, who has acquired a notion of artistic elaboration not altogether in keeping with the ancient spirit of the myths. He was, h6wever, the last member of one of the West-Coast families, the West-Coast-Gi'tAns, a fact which adds some interest to

his version.

there was none to be seen. Then he wanted to drink [his] water. And Eagle did not want to give his (own) to him. A long time (Raven) wished to drink his water. And when he refused him, he wanted to drink it unobserved. And he drank it secretly, unseen (by Eagle). And he went off with it. Then he spit it out upon all lands. He also came to this land. And he spit out QalA'n first. Therefore he is the elder brother of all the streams in Masset Inlet. When the water was almost gone from his mouth, he came here (to Masset). Therefore the water here is red. And he went on again. He came out opposite to where a whale was blowing about. And when he stood opposite it, he said to the whale, "Hahai'ya, whale, swallow me." He said this to it because he wanted to eat it. And it swallowed him. Then the whale swam about with him. Then he ate the heart of the whale. And when it was almost dead it went ashore. And when it was left by the tide, he made a hole with his beak right over its heart, and came through. Then he ate. He lived right behind it. He ate for a long time. And when he tired of eating it, he went away. And after he, had gone along for a while, he came to a certain place to live. Then he whittled some sticks down thin. And when he had many he put them into the fire. And he lay behind them. And he said, "Burn forever, burn forever." And, in spite of what he said, they burned up. Then he did the same thing again. And he again put them into the fire. When

Then he again went for some, and he got many. He carried them into the house. And when he got there he put stones into the fire. And he steamed them (the roots). And after he had cooked them he took the coverings off. Then he went away from there again. And after he had gone on for a while, he came to live in one place.

Then he saw killer-whales swim by in front of the place where he was. And he became angry because they did not come to live with him, and he went to the rock.

Then they began to give them food. And the chief's wife said, "What will the chief's son eat?" - "Give black-cod to the chief's son," said her husband. "Say that I know how 'to eat that," said Raven to Butterfly. "The chief's son says he does not know how to eat it," said Butterfly. Then blackcod was put before them, and only Butterfly ate it. "The chief's son says he wishes some dried salmon," said Butterfly. Raven did not say so, but he said he said it. Then they burned the skins of dried salmon and set them before him.

"Say that I know how to eat it," said Raven to Butterfly. "The chief says he does not know how to eat it," said Butterfly. Then it was put before them, and Butterfly ate all of it. "I wonder what the chief will eat. Does not the chief know how to eat dried berries?" said the chief's wife again. "Say that I know how to eat them," said Raven to Butterfly. Butterfly said, "The chief does not know how to eat them." And when they were put before them, Butterfly ate all. "I wonder what the chief will eat.

Again Butterfly said, "The chief says he does not know how to eat them." Then they were set before them, and Butterfly ate all. Raven ate nothing. Only Butterfly was filled. Then they went away. And after they had walked along for a while, they came to where a stream flowed down. And the stream was deep. Then Raven walked over first. He was angry because Butterfly had eaten everything up first. And when Butterfly came after him, he laid kelp across for him. "Now, cousin, walk over upon it," said Raven to Butterfly. "No,

Then Butterfly was drowned, and floated down stream. "In Raven's head, towards my son,"' sang Raven. Then he cut Butterfly's belly open and ate up all of the things he had eaten. .Then he went away; and after he had gone along for a while, he came to the crows, who were throwing hairseal back and forth. And he wanted to do it with them. Then they refused him, for they did not want him to eat all of their hair-seal. And after he had talked them tired, they let him join them. And when they found out that he was eating long cuts of the hair-seal when their backs were turned, they stopped. Then he went away. And after he had gone on for a while, he came to a point. And he found a spring salmon jumping about in the sea. He said, "Ahaiya', spring salmon! strike my heart with your head." Then the spring salmon struck him over the heart. And he fainted. And when he came to himself, after a time, he did not see the spring salmon. And after he had done this four times, he dug four holes in the ground. When he again saw the spring salmon jumping about, where he had jumped up on the land, he said to it, "A hai'ya, spring salmon!" Then it jumped at him again. And after it had knocked him senseless, and had started back,

And after he had steamed it for a while and had gone a little distance away, the roots of a tree that had fallen over sat upon it. So he did not eat it. And he started away again without having eaten. And after he had gone on for a while, he came to where Shrew lived. When Shrew went in under the ferns, he entered with him. Then he entered a big house with him. And he (Shrew) gave him food. Then he set before him a piece of dry fish in a tray. "When I have eaten this one piece, I shall still be hungry," thought Raven. And Shrew saw his mind. "Eat my food. It will not be consumed," said Shrew. Then he took it as directed, and it was still there. And when he again took it, it was still there. He ate for a long time. And it was still in (the tray). And with the food still in it, he gave it back.
And after that, he (Shrew) put one cranberry in front of him (Raven) in a dish. "Shall I be filled when I eat this one thing?" thought Raven again. And Shrew again saw his mind. "Eat mine. It will not be consumed," said Shrew to Raven. Then he took the cranberry up with a spoon. And one was still in (the dish). And when he took that up also, it was in the same place.

And after he had helped him for a while, he cut a hole through his canoe. Then he started away from him. And Heron's mind was very sick. And after he had set out from him, and had gone on for a while, he came to where Cormorant lived. And Cormorant was married. Then (Raven) went into his house.

And while they were going, Raven said to Cormorant, "There is a louse on top of your head." Then he (Cormorant) wished him to take it off. Then he went to him. And he took it off from him. He said to him, "Put out your tongue." Then (Cormorant) put his tongue out. And when (Raven) put the louse upon (Cormorant's) tongue, he pulled his tongue. He did not have a louse. He fooled him. Then Cormorant became dumb, and stopped speaking. And they landed where he lived. Then they put the halibut off on the beach. And Raven took all of the big halibut for himself. although he had not killed one. Then Cormorant pointed his fingers at the halibut. He tried to tell his wife. And his wife did not know why he did it. And after they had put all of the halibut off on the beach, they laid it near the house. Then Cormorant's wife cut all the halibut up. And they hung it up. And they dried it. Then Raven staid a long time with him. And when he had eaten all of his halibut, he started away from him. And after he had gone on for a while, he came to two islands. And he entered the house of a certain person who lived upon one of the islands. He was married. His name was Wood-Shaving-Supernatural-Being. The island was a small one.

And when the salmon-season came, he and his sister set their house near a salmon-creek. And when many salmon came to it, he brought some to his sister. Then his sister cut them and hung them up. And she dried them. He got salmon during a long time. And when the house was full he stopped. "I wonder how Suiwa's happens to have such a great plenty of food," said Raven. Then the salmon all came to life, and went back towards the creek, because he used the wrong words.' He still remained with his sister. Then he made his sister sick. She had syphilis. She was sick for a long time. And he told his sister of a medicine. Then his sister went to prepare it for herself when he had told her the different things. And when his sister went after them, he said to her, "When you come to the swamip, call for one of the different kinds, and it will answer, 'Yes.'" And when she sat where the medicine said, "Yes, she was healed.2 Raven sometimes made himself (look) like a human being. And sometimes he made himself (look) like a raven. Then he again started away from his sister. And after he had gone along for a while, and had come to a certain place, he lived there. Then he built a big house there for himself.

The "bad words" used were of such a kind that I was never able to get any one to tell them to me. 2 This is also somewhat expurgated from the Skidegate version (see Bull. 29, Bureau of American Ethnology, p. 127). 3 "Looking-at-the-Sea," the name given to a mountain in the Ninstints country, having precipitous sides. His story is much altered from that told of him at Skidegate.

days. And after five days were passed, his father started off, and he went with his father. He came with him to the place where his father lived. His father's house was large. Then he staid with his father, and his father gave him food, and he became proud. Then he acted like one of a high family who never eats much. And every day afterward he refused to take food. During the long time he remained with his father, he refused to take food. And his father's servants were numerous. Then he asked them, "What makes people hungry?" because he wished to take food. Then they said to him, "They eat scabs four times." His father, Qeiga, said this to him. Then he did so four times. And before many days were passed, he became hungry. Then he ate much, and was always hungry. And after he had done so for a long time, he was always hungry. Then he ate all of the different kinds of berries with which his father's house was filled. And when they had eaten all, his father, Qenga, said, "Put my son outside. He is eating the whole inside of the house." Then he turned him out. And he used to lie against the front of the house. He became sick. He made himself sick. He became sick by making his thigh sore with his nails. And when he lay against the front of the houte, he knocked his beak against the house. 'Let me in. I am starving to death," he said.. And his father paid no attention to him. And next day they started off. Then he had one box of salmoneggs left. And they (his father's family)

him. And after they had gone along for a while by canoe, his mother smelt the salmon-eggs. His mother said, _"Child, what smells so?" "My taking the scab off my sore thigh made the smell," said Raven. He made a hole in the salmon-eggs with his beak. When they arrived, they discovered that he had eaten them. That was what they smelt. And when they landed, they (the parents) refused to have him for a child. And when they cast him out, he ceased being sick. He was not -sick, but he was fooling them. And when night came, he went away again.
Then he went far. And he came to all the different kinds of shell-fish, which were going to make war. HIe said, "I will go along with you." "All right, go along beside us," they said to him. And they went. And he went alongside of them. Then they went along beside him. And when the cockles made themselves go by means of their tongues, (he said), "Keep away, cockles, I will bite pieces out of you." Then they warred around this island, and they warred around Mainland also. When people eat them (at this time of the year), they eat them by mistake, and may die.' And after they had gone around the

Then Raven made himself dead because he wanted to be born from her. Then the woman was pregnant for a long time. And when she was about to give birth, she was in pain. And he came out of her thigh. Then she used to hold him. Then the child grew up quickly. This was the woman who owned the moon. He had himself born from her because he wanted the moon. And this woman was called Moon-Woman. Then the child cried a great deal. And when he cried, he said, ABoohoo, moon!" Then his mother said, "One talks about a thing beyond his reach which the supernatural beings own." And when the child cried again, he kept saying, "Boo-hoo, moon; boohoo, moon!" Then, when her mind was tired out with 'the noise, she stopped up the holes in the house. She stopped up the smoke-hole. And she stopped up the small holes as well. Then she untied the strings from the box. Although they were very strong, she untied them. She did this for the moon which was inside. Then she took the moon out. And she let him play with it. She did not give it to him. She only let him play with it to quiet him. And after his mother had gone outside, he took up the moon in his beak. Then he flew about the house with it, after he had transformed himself into a raven. He made himself small. And just before his mother got in, he turned himself into a child, such as he had been before. Then he again played with the moon. And he again began to cry loudly.

And when he cried, he said, "Boo-hoo, smoke-hole; boo-hoo, smoke-hole; boohoo, moon; boo-hoo, moon!" He said this for a long time. Then he again cried his mother's mind tired. And she opened the smoke-hole a little. Then he cried still more. And he kept saying, "Boo-hoo, more!" for a long time. Then she made the opening in the smoke-hole larger. And he kept saying, "Boo-hoo more!" And he again played with the moon. Raven cried because he wanted the moon. And his mother did not want to give it to him. Then, when he cried very much, she made a large opening at the smoke-hole. At that time it was dark, therefore he let himself be born for the moon. He did not like the darkness. Then he again played with the moon. And after she had made the opening in the smoke-hole larger, his mother went out again. Then he held the moon in his mouth. And he flew through the smoke-hole. And he had put the moon under his wing. Then he called (like a raven) on top of the house with the moon under his arm. Then he made himself into a raven again. And he flew away during the night with the moon under his wing. Then he sat on the bank of Nass River, where they were taking olachen. And it was dark. And he called out. He said to them, "Say! if you bring me your spruce-needles, I will make it light for you." He called the olachen spruce-needles. And he said the same thing again.

Raven had filled the canoe by himself, they started off. Grisly-Bear killed on halibut. Then they took the halibut out of the canoe. And after they had entered the house, they lighted a fire. Then Raven put stones into the fire. And the stones were very hot. Then GrislyBear went out, and when he again entered, he said, "I am very hungry." Said Raven, "When people feel hungry, they swallow hot stones. I ate hot stones, and I am not hungry. You eat them also." Then Grisly-Bear took hot stones out of the fire, and ate them. He ate four, and stopped eating. Then Grisly-Bear felt that his insides were cooked. And not a long time afterward he died. Raven did not eat stones, but fooled him. He said so because he wanted to eat Grisly-Bear.' People did not know that he was Raven. He was like a human being. And only when he got through doing something did he turn himself into Raven. And when he saw human beings, he made himself like human beings. Then he began to eat GrislyBear.

Although they spoke to him, he did not see their bodies. And when evening came he went away. And after he had gone along for a while, he found an abelone-shell.1 When he found it, he was very happy over it. Then he pierced it to hang it to his ear. And after he had gone along for a while, holding it, he came to a big town. Then, just before he came in front of the town, he put it in one ear at one end of the town. And when he passed in front, (they were dazzled as if) they saw the Then they said to him, "Say! sun. chief, let us look at your (abelone).""No, I will not show it to you. It is very precious. I am going to show it to people around the entire earth," said he to them. And when he had gotten past the town, he took it off. And he always kept it in the palm of his hand. After he had gone along for a while, he came to where a certain woman lived. He married her. It was Mink.' Mink wanted to marry him for the abelone. Then she was with child by him. And it was a boy. And when it got a little larger he thought, "Suppose I let my child die". His wife loved her child very much. He, too, loved his child very much. The town was large. Then his child died. And he made it lie up against the wall in the back part of the house. Then he called all of the town-people. And they all

He (Raven) said, "When a person's child is dead, he will not be sad for it.' And he could not bring it about. Therefore to the present day, people are sad for their children, and (they are so) because he was sad. Then GreatestLaugher laughed out, although Raven had forbidden any one to laugh. Therefore, now, when their friends have died, (people) laugh before them after they have cried. Then he was going to cease staying with his wife. And he had given herthe abelone-shell. Then he started away from her. And he travelled alone. And while he was passing at the foot of a mountain, some one on top of the mountain called out. Then he, also. stood beneath. He who called was Butterfly. He lived on top of the mountain. (Butterfly) wanted to be his servant, therefore he called to (Raven) when he saw him coming. Then he became (Raven's) companion. When he tried to become his servant, (Raven) refused him for a time, because Butterfly was always hungry. Besides, he had a big stomach. He already knew that in speaking for him he would tell lies about him. He knew it in his mind. And when he went from that place, he came to a woman. Butterfly was with him.

And then he said to his sister, "Go to the other side (landward) and dig roots. Do not go down to the sea," said he to her. Then he made her a digging-stick with which to dig roots. And when she brought them from the other side, Butterfly ate them all. Then he pushed his sister's diggingstick into the ground outside. The digging-stick is still sticking in the ground there.

And when he gave it to him, he gave it to him in a stone tray. And a cover was over it. Then he went away from him with it.

Then he entered the house in which his sister lived. Butterfly was also there with her. Then he lighted a fire in his house. Because he put a piece of fire into the cedar, when people try to light a fire with cedar by means of a fire-drill, fire comes from it. Then he called all the fishes that had wanted to kill him, - devil-fish, whale, sculpin, 8asi'n, killer-whale. Then the fishes all came into his house. And when they all got in, he stopped up the holes in the house. He made it dark. Then he left only a small peeping-hole through which he could see when it was morning.1 And after he had watched for morning for a while, and it began to grow light, he pushed the door open quickly and ran out. Then he shouted at them. When he shputed, they all became stones. He deceived them, because they wanted to kill him. And he destroyed them. Then he came out and said that he was going to give his sister in marriage. He said it, although there was no one to be seen to whom to offer his sister. He said, "Who will marry my sister?" When he said so, "I, I, I, I, I!" said Grisly-Bear. They were very anxious to marry her. Grisly-Bear was the first who wanted to marry her. He said to him, "What thing can you do?" When I see people, I will roar," he said. "You are too bad-tempered," said he to him. He refused him. Then he again spoke as before. "Who will marry sister?" he said. "I!" said Wolf.

At that time he let still more drop. As soon as he had let it drop, he bent it together. And he made a circle out of it. Then it stopped running off. Because he bent it together, all streams keep on running, although they run every day. After that, he went up alongside of it. And he climbed to the top of a mountain which stood far (inland).

time he made himself into a woman. Then she said, "People will lie here with me. When they are going to the Dinne, people will lie with me, so that they may not die." And because she lay there, her well there became round and small. She said this so that when they came and drank from this, they might become strong. And she remained there forever. But then her soul came from her body, and her (body) changed to stone. He however, after he had come down from there, went on again. When he went away, he came to a tidal pond full of herring. Then he began to carry them up to the woods on his shoulders. There were many herring. And he was very tired. At that time he said to the stones scattered about, "Get up and help me. I am tired,. he said. So the stones got up. And they were unable to stand erect. Then he said, "Remain stones forever." And the grass on the landward side of the stones was thick, and the salmon-berry-bushes were thick. Then he said to the salmon-berry-bushes and the grass, "Get up. Get up and help me. I am tired," he said. Then the grass and the salmon-berry-bushes both rose. And they turned into human beings. And these helped him. So we are salmon-berry-bushes and grass. Therefore all die in a short time, because salmon-berry-bushes and grassare weak. Therefore people die just in the way that leaves fall. He went on again from that (place).

And he threw away two of its arms. Therefore the devil-fish now has eight arms. But after that, he went fishing with his brother-in-law.' And they returned from fishing. And the ground on which they fished- was named Kz5k!Alo't. People still fish at Kak!Alo't. And they took halibut-shoulders. He took all from his sister for himself. I-is sister was also there. Then his sister's heart was sick, and she put her child upon her back. Then she went away and sat at the end of the point, because he took all of the shoulders from her. And she turned to stone there. She still has her child upon her back. She is called The Sitter.2 And the halibut are still to be seen there.3 He went some distance from there to Me'akun4 when the tide was low. And he went to the beach. All that time, Butterfly went about with him. And where he went down, he came to upon big pond. He had a stick in his hand. And he went into the water.

"I eat nothing but mice and snails." Therefore he named himI LAgaskA'manat. And when his heart was tired, he ate only their eyes. Then he went away and made this inlet with his finger. When he came to where the strong tidal flow is, he saw some women drifting down rapidly in it. There were ten in the canoe. And they were capsized in it. And after they got up on the bottom of the canoe, they wept much. And when his heart was sick on account of them, he cut off the nose of a skate.1 Then he pushed it into the rapid current. And he stopped the tide. And a mountain stands there until this day. It is called Skate's-Forehead.' After that he went farther on. Then he came to a town of the Duck-People. And he saw them getting shellfish. They were in canoes. They were just in front of the town. Then he hid himself. They all dived for sea-eggs, and brought up the sea-eggs in their mouths. Then they threw them into their canoes which floated above. When their canoes were full, he came out. He showed himself for the first time. He put mud upon the things he wore. He put it all over. After he had finished and came out, he talked angrily with them. Although he was not angry, he pretended to be, for he wanted the sea-eggs.

And the rock burst open. Then he escaped into it. At that time he made a spear for the wind. Then he speared this wind. Therefore there is no wind there now. After he had left that place, he came to where Greatest-Eagle lived. And he went in to him. And when he got in to him, he told him to sit near by. Then he said to him, "What will you eat, my son? Can you eat the whale which is on the side towards the door?" said he to him. "No," he said to him. "What, then?" said he to him. He said to him, "Your hands." Then Eagle warmed his hands. And grease came out from his hands. His hands were stained with grease because he killed whales with his talons. Then he sucked out all of the grease. And he lied to him, saying, "I have fasted ten days." Then he (Greatest-Eagle) was angry with him because he had sucked out all his grease. After that, he also travelled upon Seaward Island.'

Then this half, was full of human beings. And the other half was full of animals. Then he told them to make a town behind the place where they then were. And he told the animals to go into the mountains. And he told many to go to this island. Then this island was too small for them. He was not pleased with this, and took part of the animals to the other side. Then he told only the Black-Bear, Marten, and Land-Otter to be here. And the strip of ocean between was narrow. The tide flowed back and forth in this, and he pushed the islands apart with his feet. Then he saw that the Crow-People had no houses for themselves. At that time he said to them, "Enter the big mountain standing in the woods, for it is your grandfather. And you will be happy there." Then they went up to it and went into it. " Come hither, grandchildren," it said to them. Therefore the mountain is the Crows' grandfather. At that time there was no tree to be seen. And after they had lived for a while in (the mountain), the weather became bad. "Now, grandchildren, go out, he said, "and the sun will shine." And when they got out of their grandfather's house, they all laughed as they went down to the sea. Then the sun shone. Therefore now, when it is going to be sunshine, the crows caw. When he went away from there, he came to another bird that had no home.

It was the only one (of its kind). (This which was) the Woodpecker said he had no place in which to live. When he wanted to stay with other birds, they would not let him. And since there was no place for him to live in, he flew about the entire island. And he looked around upon this island for some place in which to live. Then Raven said to him, " Fly to Laxai'ik'."' He told him to go thither because a decayed thing stood at the mouth of Laxai'ik'. "Hammer the decayed thing standing there with your bill, for it is your grandfather," he said to him. Still he was afraid of it. When this decayed thing knew that he was afraid of it, it said to him, "Come here, grandchild. Live in my heart. Then your children will not be houseless." Therefore he now lives in it because it is his grandfather. Afterwards he went on again. Then he came to a big mountain. There was not a tree to be seen upon it. It extended into the sea. It also reached far inland. And there was no way to cross it. Then he hunted for a strong stick. At that time he made a hole with his stick on the dry land. And then he went through it. "The last generation of people even shall go through this," he said. "When they go through, they will not be sick," said he. Now, when sickness is about, and they are afraid of it, the Tlingit pass through, on account of what Raven said. And having passed through, he went far away. Then he made a big lake.

And he dug a trench (leading) out of it. " Every time people float in this current, they will capsize," he said. It happens that way now. And when he went away, he came to Laxai'ik'. And there were no olachen to be seen in the river. Then he saw something big far out at sea. It was like half a house. Then Butterfly brought him something black.' There was no way to go out to that. At that time, Butterfly brought him this black thing. He pointed it towards that thing out at sea. Then it grew. And it took hold of it. Then he drew it landward. And then he brought it ashore, Butterfly helping him. The thing he drew ashore was full of olachen. Then he told them to go into the river. Therefore there are now very many olachen in it. But after that, he began to make a canoe. He used a tc!a'nAni-tree for it. And when he was about to set out, he took sand in one hand. Then he threw it into the sea, to make a shallow place seaward. Then he went out. And when he got far out at sea, he said, "When (people) have gone shoreward from this place, they shall not capsize." Although there were no waves to be seen at that time, he floated ashore (as if there were). And as he stood paddling, he shouted, " Hao, hao!" (to keep time). And when he got near, two big waves came after him. When the waves were about to break, he said, "I will not capsize." One of the waves broke, and he went ashore upon the other. And when he got near

land, his canoe struck a rock in the sea. Then he capsized.' At that time, Butterfly was walking along behind him. Then he (Raven) lay upon the canoe. He said to Butterfly, "Come and get me." Butterfly had never been on the sea. He was afraid of it. And when he refused, he (Raven) was angry with him. He spoke because he wanted Butterfly to go into the sea. Butterfly was short and wide. Then (Raven) saved himself. " Why did 'you not come out to me?" he said to (Butterfly). Butterfly wanted to stay with the olachen. Therefore he was not with him. And (Raven) asked him if he had eaten the olachen. This is why there are now many waves.° After that, he came back here (to the Queen Charlotte Islands). He came to one who was drying salmon. And he staid with him. He had very many salmon. His house was full. Outside he also had many drying-frames. He (Raven) said to him, "Valuable abelones are over there." He lied to him. "Go and get them," he said to him. Then he (the man) went with his wife to get them. "I, too, will go with you," he said to him. And he fastened a shell to the sole of his foot. He did it before he came to (the And when he man and his wife). pushed the canoe out, he said to the man, "Get in at the bow." Then he told the woman to stay in the stern.

And he did not answer his sister. Then he took off the things that were over her husband. And she found that it was her husband's dead body. "Why did he die?" she asked him. He concealed the fact that he had eaten all the insides out of his brother-in-law. And when she saw that he had eaten all the insides out of his brother-in-law, she said to him, "Did you do it?Let us bury him," she said to him (Raven). So they went to bury him. Afterwards he again went away from his sister. Then he came to 2odju'was.1 At that time it was not light. Then they were fishing for olachen with a fishrake. He said, "Sa-ay, give me one of those evergreen-needles." He called olachen " evergreen-needles." "No-o," they said to him.2 Then he started away. At that time he was thirsty. Then he made a water-hole with his bill. Then he drank. Now the water-hole is called "Water-Hole-made-by-Bill." 3 Butterfly went about with him all that time. And he went away again.

Then Butterfly said, "The one coming has salmon-heads hanging from his nose, hn hn!" "Hn hn! don't say that. Say 'Weasels,'" he said. Then they again started from the town.

Then Butterfly left him. And he began to make a canoe in an uninhabited place. His sister also staid with him. His sister's child also staid with him. Then he went along in a canoe. And he saw something going about in the water and paddled to it. Then the salmon came into his canoe. And he went off with it. Then, when he landed, he called to his sister.

Then his sister gave it to him. And he put it around his waist. He called his sister's belt a war-belt." Then he let himself fall down in a sitting posture. He let the weapons strike him.

And early in the morning her motherin-law went out (to defecate) with her. Then her mother-in-law said, " My child's wife has a tail." And she said, "He, this is not the first time that the Breech-Clout-Women have had tails. I wonder why she said that." Her mother-in-law questioned her, because she saw her tail. Her tail, alone, she could not get rid of. Sometimes she (Raven) became a man. Sometimes he (Raven) turned himself into a woman. Then she again started away from this town. And she left her husband.' Then Butterfly again went with him. He had made him alive again. And he came to where the Shadows lived. And he entered the house. Then salmon-roe put up in hair-seal-stomach lay in it. There were no people to be seen there. And he wanted the salmnon-roe. And he took it up. Then he went off with it, and when he reached the door they pulled him back. And the Shadows picked up their salmon-roe again and put it back. Then he went to it again, and picked it up. And again he started off with it. And when he reached the door he was pulled back again.

(Told by Richard.)
One time the story of Raven's going was like this. When he came to a certain town, they were very glad to see him. They loved him. His gait was not like theirs. "Why do you walk like that?" they said to him. He laughed. "Xe!" he said. 'Is this the first time you have seen women of the Tail-hanging-from-the-Back family?" he said to them. They did not know what he was talking about, but still they liked him.'

By and by they went fishing. And they paddled out to the fishing-grounds, and stopped there. When Raven guessed that they had tied the bait to their hooks, he passed behind a point of land. He went under the sea. He came under the place where they were fishing. Then he came to where their bait lay around in the water. And taking their bait off, he ate it. But afterwards he jerked their lines. And the fishing-people jerked them up, because they thought the halibut were doing it. They did not know that Raven was doing it. He consumecF all the bait of the fishermen. And they did not kill a single halibut. All went back. Then Raven came to the town beWa'Lu L!a kuna'stAn Ye'le isinan 35 fore them.

They believed.that he had put his hands to his lips because he did not know about it. The townspeople did not know that he was a foolish fellow. After they had gotten more bait, they went fishing again. When he knew that they had gone fishing, he again went seaward. He went to the same place. He again began to tear off their bait as he had before. He continued to do this for some time. Then he began to eat off of a certain person's hook.

At that moment this fisherman pulled haphazard. He felt something move about a great deal on the hook. What he had jerked the hook into was Raven's lower beak. He (Raven) did not see any way of getting it out. Although he held himself by the seaweeds growing under water, he became too weak to hold on there. He (the fisherman) pulled him up. He (Raven) was in much distress. After he had pulled him up to the bottom of the canoe, he put his arms around it (the canoe) to hold himself. But then he pulled away his beak. He (the fisherman) showed it (Raven's beak) to them. All the fishermen looked at it. No one knew what it was. "Now let us all go home," they said. So they did.

had pulled up from the bottom of the ocean. Then he was wearing his blanket.' He held it right up around his nose (to conceal the loss of his beak). "Let me see it, too," he said. They gave it to him. "Say! long ago, when they. pulled up a similar thing at a town, without taking a single thing away, they (fled), saving their bodies only." And they believed what he told them. They did so. They did not take any food with them. He fooled them in order to eat the food they had abandoned in their flight. Not even one knew that it was his beak. As soon as they gave it to him, he put it back into its place. Then they left him alone in the town. He first ate the food in a house at one end of the town. He consumed it. He did the same to the next house. By doing so, he consumed all of the food in the big town. He knew well how to tell lies (to get food), because what he ate never staid long in his stomach. After he had done these things, he went away again.
At that time he again looked about for some town. So he came to one. He entered a house standing in the middle of the town he came to. He saw that there was no one there. He saw that a great quantity of food was piled up in the house. He was very much pleased with it, because he was a great eater. That was why, when he saw plenty of food, he was much pleased at it. So lhe was much pleased at the food' piled up in this house. He ran right up to it. He pulled the

He saw only shadows about the house. He threw down the food. It lay beneath him. Again he gathered it together, and again he tried to go out. When he got near the door, they again pulled his hair very much. Then he threw down the salmon. Then he became tired. After he had sat near the door for a while, he started off again.' At that time he went a long distance. Then he came to a town. At that time he changed himself into a woman. Then they looked at him. "A very handsome woman is coming," they said. At that time the town-chief said, "Call her." And so they called her. She entered. They laid down a mat for her in the back part of the house. They made her sit upon it. Then they prepared food for her. When they set it before her, she looked about upon the faces of all those who were in the house. One said, "Why are we afraid of the eyes of the chief's child who has come in ?" She heard this. "He!" she said. "Is it not right to look about?" she also said. But then she took the food. She ate. She consumed all of the great quantity of salmon. Then they were astonished at her. Chiefs' daughters did not eat much then. Therefore they wondered at her. Then they laid cranberries before her. Then she looked round on all

who were in the house, as she had done before. After it, she ate all of this (dish). At that time, when people gave food to others, they gave them twelve different kinds. But still she consumed two kinds of food after the salmon. Then they said, "Now that is enough." Now the town-chief wanted to ask something of her. So he said to her, "Do you wish to marry my son?" The woman said in turn, "All right, I am pleased." This was the beginning of marriage.

Early next morning they began to give her and her husband food. But then they gave them twelve different kinds of food. Still she was not yet filled. Not long afterwards they again gave them food. Then they put more food into the trays. They filled the trays still higher. Still she finished all. That night they built a large (winter) fire. They gave them food around it. Then they gave them twelve different kinds of food, one after the other, to eat. Then they went to bed. While they slept, the chief's daughter got up. At that time there was a great quantity of different kinds of food in the townchief's house. She knew this. Therefore she got up. She untied the cover from a box of grease that was in the midst of them. At that time they put up nothing but whale-oil. Therefore she took that out and ate it. .

that she was full. When she first began to go about, they told her to take a " hungry-medicine." She did so. Therefore she was not satisfied by eating. Her medicine was this. She ate scales of dead skin off of her ankle. This is how she became hungry. By doing this thing, she came to be in that condition. Towards morning she went to her husband. Her husband asked her, "Whence have you come?" The woman told her husband in turn the reason for the thing her husband had asked of her. She lied to her husband, saying, "I went outside because my stomach was sick." From the time when she first began to go about, she knew how to tell lies. This is what she said to her husband. Her husband believed her. Afterwards, before day came, they spread out a mat for them, as they had done before. That was the way they did to chiefs' children when they were married. Therefore they did the same to them. Then they took food to them. They gave them all kinds of food to eat, as they had done before. After it was finished, her mother-inlaw said to her, "Why is not my son's wife satisfied when she eats?" When she heard it, she said to her husband, "Stay in the house." Her husband agreed to it. She said this because the berries that had been defecated by those who had eaten them were washed ashore in front of the town. So, after she had watched the faces of those outside for a while, she put the berries that were being washed ashore into her mouth quickly7. Now was to be seen why she moved her eyes around

She went away and came in. Then night came. Then they were again going to give them food. But at that time she did not eat much, because she remembered what her mother-in-law had said. She was very hungry. But still she did not eat much, because she was afraid on account of what her mother-in-law had said. Although this would be the third (time), she continued to consume some of the boxes of oil, not going to sleep, on account of eating them, the whole night. Before she had staid a long time with her husband, she consumed half of the food in the house. When night came again, she removed the cover from another box of oil. Then she took out very good whale-oil. Therefore she ate hurriedly. While she was eating, her labret dropped into it. About the time (girls) reached maturity, they used to wear labrets in their lips. Hers dropped into this oil. At that time day began to break. There was no way of finding her labret. Then, leaving her labret in it, she She lay down by her went away. husband. At that time her husband asked her, "How is it that you smell of whale"I don't know," said the oil?" woman. This was all he asked his wife. While he was speaking, day began to dawn [became white].

Then they opened the very (box) out of which she had stolen the night before. They poured oil out of it into the tray. Then they told the others they had found the labret in the oil. The chief woman wished to see it. So they showed it to her. Then she looked at it. She recognized it. "Say!" she said, "this is my son's wife's labret." - "It is my labret," she (Raven) said. "That is the way the little thing always does when it wants oil," she said of her labret. This is the way she tried to make up lies about it quickly.

Now, the people in the house knew what she was like. So they watched her. They quickly found out that she was like that. They told it to the people of the town. Then all of them told her they disliked her. They sent her away from the town.' This is the way she travelled about. She was a great eater. Therefore they began to dislike her wherever she staid.

And when he got behind their house, he made himself small. Then the four women went to get things. And they found the small boy. Then the three eldest were much pleased with him. But the youngest was afraid of him. She said he was a bad man. The youngest was wise. And when they came back with him, they chewed dried salmon, and placed it side of him. Then they went away from him again, shutting the door. Then he got out of the cradle. And he peeped out at them. And after they had disappeared in the woods, he made himself large. Then he pulled down the salmon and roasted it. And when it was cooked, he ate. And after it was finished, and it was almost time for them to come home, he made himself small and got into the cradle.

1 The ambiguous way in which this story is told, combined with the foreign elements entering into it, and the fact that my informant was a young man who bad often been to Victoria, and who wanted to tell me about Raven's doings in the neighborhood of that place, which he had learned from Victoria Indians, - all lead to the suspicion that this is not a true Haida story. It may be of some interest, however, to have it recorded as having been picked up by a Haida. I have placed it immediately after the Raven Story, because it seems to b)elong to the same class of myths. The adventure with the salmon is like one of Raven's experiences; the consultation of the excrements is found in stories told farther south; and an adventure similar to the hero's in saving the orphans is told of Spider, the Dakota trickster.

And in the morning, when they- again went after things, he ran out of the cradle and began to cook salmon for himself. And he ate while they were away. And when they had almost reached home, he made himself small again and got into the cradle. And when they came in, the youngest saw that there were fragments around the fire. And when night came again, he got out of the cradle while they were asleep. Then he made himself large again. And he again pulled down the salmon and roasted it. Then he ate. And after he had eaten, he went to the youngest. While she slept, he made fun of her. And when day came, and they had gone to get things, he roasted food. And he ate. Then he went away. After he had gone along for a while, he saw a man walking on ahead of him. And he merely looked at him secretly. Then he saw that he was standing near the tide, saying, "Hahai'ya!" to a steel-head salmon. And after he had stood there shouting for a while, the steel-head salmon made a jump at him. And it struck him (the man) over the heart with its head. Then he (the man) rolled about there in pain. And the steel-head salmon dove into the water. But then (the man) put a circle of stones around himself. Then he shouted, " Flahai'ya!" at (the salmon) again. And when the man got strong, he clubbed it to death behind the stones.

And after he had finished, he walked up to the woods again and looked at him stealthily. And after that, this man got up. And when he got up, he rubbed his hair, and said, "Who did this to me? Who did this to me?" After he had said this, he went a little way off and defecated. Then he said, "My sister, who did this to me?" And his excrement said, "The one who was eating food over there, to whom you did it first, did the same to you." "Good!" he said. "When people do this way to a person, after some time has passed, he will do the same," he said. -Then he again went away.

And after he had gone along for a while, he came to the place where they say he lived. And after he had travelled about there for a while, a woman called to him. And he came to the woman.

But still this woman again called him. She was always lying down. The men who had come to her before, she had killed. Then he again said, "No, I never sleep with women." And she again called to him.

the stones behind him (the child) were red-hot, he told him to go in again. Then the child replied, "This is cold. You go into it," he said to him. Then this child thought, aI wish I could make him angry." And when the chief became angry, he entered the steaming-box. The stones felt cold to him. Then he (the child) threw the mats upon him. Then the child wished. "May these mats become heavy upon him," he thought. So they did lie heavily upon him, and (the water in) the box began to boil very much. And when this began to boil, the chief burst [in it]. And after he (the child) had pulled (the covers) off from him (the chief), and had called for the children, they pulled his dead body outside. "They will not do such things to each other again," he said. Those were orphans whom this chief had eaten. "After this, orphans will be taken care of," he said. And when he lived in (the ogre's) he took very good care of the orphans. And after he had taken care of them for a very long time, he went away. After he had gone along for a while, he came to another town. And when he arrived there, he saw people sitting in rows in the water. Then he questioned them. "What are you doing?" he said. Then they replied, "We are catching salmon. We are making traps of ourselves." And he said to them again, "Let me fix them for you." And he told them to go up, and he made them sit across the river in a row. He said to them, "Spread your legs apart wide enough for salmon. When they had arranged their

And after they had killed many salmon, they were very fond of him. Those people did not have a chief. Therefore they made him their chief. When evening came, they went back into the house with the salmon they had caught. And they did not allow this man to sleep on the ground. "Take hold of one another's hands, and I will lie upon them," he said to them. So he lay upon them as they lay down. Next day he again told them to stand above the river. And they got many salmon. When evening again came, he did the same thing to them. They sat down for him, and he lay upon their arms. When day again came, he told them to stand in a row, and they killed the salmon. And after they had done this for some time, one came in at the door while he was lying upon their arms. Then he (the new-comer) said to him, "Are you a chief?" At that time he did not speak to him. He said to him, "I am not going to say anything to you." He (the new-comer) said to him, "Come down." Then he said in reply, "I am not going to say anything to you." After he had said this to him, he (the new-comer) started towards him. When he went in to him, the one who was lying upon their arms went down to meet him. Then they seized each other.

At Qaik!2 lived a man who had been a very good grisly-bear hunter when he was young. He always killed them. Sometimes he shot five; sometimes he shot four. He kept on doing it. And he grew old in (the profession). Then they did not give food to him at the town of Qaik!. And he went to live in an uninhabited place where he used to hunt grisly bear. He and his wife were the only two there. And there they continued to live. His house always stood there. Nothing that they might eat was to be seen. The food was consumed. When the tide was low, she dug clams. Then she put the large (Saxidomus squalidus) and the small clams3 into a little basket. And she went up to the house with them. It (the basket) was not full. And she put them into the fire. His wife was strong. He, however, was weak. When they were cooked, she set them before her husband. Then he took them, felt of them, and ate. After he had eaten all, his wife put the shells into something and set them outside. When evening came, and she had given her husband water, they went to bed.

And there was a little fire in front of them. Next day, after they had lain abed for a while, and morning had dawned, she put a large basket on her back. She went to find decayed bark on rotten trees. When it (the basket) was full, she put it on her back. Then she came home. And at evening they went to bed. And after they had gone to bed, he said to his wife, "When you go after clams, look for something over there" (indicating the direction with his hand). "Also keep looking for something over there." Then she went for clams. And she looked around where he had directed her. She also looked in the other place. Then she dug the clams. As she was digging, she saw a grisly bear standing there. But then she told her husband. When she entered, she said to her husband, "Over yonder there is a grisly bear coming out of the woods." - "Is it near?" She said it was. "Give me a belt," he said to his wife. And when she had given him a piece of cord, he girded himself. "Give me mybow and arrows," he said to his wife. His bow was hanging up. And when his wife had pulled it down, she gave it to him. Then he said to his wife, "Bring me two arrows only." And she handed him two. "Now shall I lead you?" she said to her husband. "Lead me to the woods. Also break a two-pointed stick on which to place the arrows," he said to his wife. Then they went together into the woods. And they came behind the place where it (the bear) stood. And they

Then he said to his wife, "Aim the arrow straight at it between the two points." And she put it between them. After he had drawn the bowstring, and she had said to him, "It is aimed exactly right," he let it go. Then (the bear) ran towards the sea. When he let go, (the arrow) went through it, and he said, "Ha! I feel as I used to when I shot a grisly bear in my youth." His wife said to him, "You missed it, bad one! It ran into the woods." She pushed him down. Then he fell on his back. And he lay there a long time. She had lie(d to her husband. While he lay there, his wife xwent down to it. The grisly bear was dead. And when her husband got up he began to call to her. And when he called to her, she did not reply. She abandoned her husband. And after she had cut it up, she began to bring it into the house. While she was putting it on her back, her husband was calling to her. And she hid her voice from him. Then she brought all of the meat into the house. And her husband called about for her. Then evening came. And after he had sat there for a while, he perceived that night had come on. Then he crept about in the woods. And he stopped calling. While he was creeping about, he crept to a trail. He left the bow where he had shot. Then he began to crawl along the trail. He did not know that he was crawling into the woods.

And as he thought, "Now let it bite her face," the grisly-bear head howled, and bit into her face. Then she was rolling about. But then he ran into the house to his wife. And having seized his wife, he ran outside with her. She said to her husband, "Take this from my face." Nevertheless he threw her on the beach with it. She rolled about with it. She soon died. And then he began to try the fat out of his bears. And he put the grease into boxes. After he had cut the meat into strips, he hung them up in the house. He dried them. All that time he kept up a fire beneath. When he brought the firewood for it, he did not forget his bow. Then he finished preparing all of the meat and grease. But at that time he saw the arrow with which he had shot the grisly bear. It was just above the place where he had lain down. When he saw it, however, he remembered his bow. Then he went to look for it. And when he saw it, it was standing against something in the woods (a tree or stump), along with the arrows. And he brought them to the place where he lived. Then he went off. He was going to return (to the town). Then he put his canoe into the water. And he laid boards in the bottom of the canoe for the meat, and placed the meat upon them.

They were very glad to see him. Then all brought his meat up to his house. After he had entered, he said, "Call the people to eat this meat." And when they called them, all the chiefs came in. He said to the crowd of people, "Cook that meat for them. Steam it." They did so. They put stones into the fire. When they were hot, they brought out two boxes for it. And after they had poured water into them, they began to put the meat in. They also put stones into them. After they had boiled for a while, the (meat) was cooked. When it was cooked, they put it into a large tray with spoons. Then they put trays in front of them. Afterwards they put the meat into them with the fat. Then they ate.

After they were through eating, he said to them, "Do not go out. I will recount (my adventures) to you." He said to those around the door (the servants), "Carry home that which is left over." So they took all of the trays to those at home. But then he was going to tell them about himself. Then they questioned him. They said to him, "Did you kill this grisly bear?" And he said, "Yes." They said to him, "How did you kill it?" They asked him how, because he had been blind. And he said, "No, indeed! (I did not go by myself). My wife took me to it. She led me be-

hind it. And she broke off a forked stick for me. Then she put my arrow between (the points). Then she aimed straight at it. When she gave the word, I shot. When I shot, it went through its heart. And it died." That is what he said. "Then my wife said to me, 'You missed it, bad one!' She concealed it (the truth) from me. And when I called to her, she did not answer me. Meanwhile she cut it up and carried it up to the house. And from sitting in the place where I had shot the bear I crept about in the woods. Then I came to a trail. And I crept along upon the trail. At that time I felt my hands go into water. Since I thought it was sea-water, I tasted it. And when I knew it was fresh water, I began to weep. "And while I was still lying beside it, I heard a bird call far away on the opposite side. After a while it began calling again near me. After some time had passed, while I lay there, I perceived that it had come out below me. Then this bird spoke to me. It said to me, 'Get upon me.' And I felt of it. And it was too small to get on. Therefore I was afraid. Then it said to me, 'No, get upon me.' And when I did get upon it, I put my head under its feathers. And it said to me, 'Put your arms around me. When your throat gets tired, scratch me. Then it dived with me.

And since all wanted to see it very much, they went outside for it. Then the old man who had shot the grisly bear said, " Let me' throw a stone at it first." So when it came into shallow water, all took stones [for it]. And the old man threw at it first. But afterwards they threw at it a great deal. Although they threw stones at it, it was not afraid. It did not want to go back. Then they stopped throwing at it. And it went straight up among them. Then it entered the chief's house, which stood in the middle of the town. Then they questioned it. "Who are you?" they said. It said "I am one who comes to give you food." It was full of olachen. "Get me something for these," it said. So they set a big tray in front of it. But then the olachen began to come out of its mouth into the tray. And the tray was filled. Then the chief said, "Distribute these among yourselves." So they shared them. Then it said to them, "When I come again, do not throw stones at me. I will give you olachen again." It came from Nass River. Then it went away from them. Two nights afterward it came over again. But then they did not throw stones at it. And they took good care of it. And when it went up, it entered the chief's house. Then it again asked for something in which to put them.

So they set something in front of it. But then it disgorged the olachen into it. At that time the tray was again filled. And again the chief said, "Give all of these to the people." Then the people shared them.
After all had been given to them, they said, "A man is coming." They said, "He is coming from the direction of the moonrise." Then he arrived at the town. This was Raven. Upon this he entered through the doorway. Then he saw these olachen before them. He made himself into a man. He said to the chief, "Let them give me olachen." - "No, they like it too well," he (the chief) said to him. And he said the same thing to him again. And he could not get it by talking. He said, "I have eaten nothing since leaving home," but still they did not want to give him food. "Who gave the olachen to you?" he said to them. "This Cormorant did it," they said to him. And after he had looked at it (the Cormorant) for a while, he said to it, "Will you not give me some also?" And it refused to do so. Then Raven said to the Cormorant, "You shall become stone where you are." And it became a stone. "Do not speak that way to us, chief," they said to him. They were afraid of him. But still he said to them, " You did not give me food. You shall also become stones." And all became stones. He did it because he wanted the olachen. But yet the olachen turned into stones along with them. The end.

And only his face was above water. And when he slept, his hair floated on the water. A nd he had a sculpin at the end of each hair. And when the Ocean-People ° came along, they saw him. Those were the killer-whales. And they began playing with his sculpins. They began to bite them off. After they had bitten them off, he stopped sleeping there. They did not eat them. They only played with them. They did this to see what his father would do. After they had finished doing this to him, he went in to his father. Then he said to his son, "Son, let them make a figure of me." And he called the Forest-People.' He called a beaver from among the beavers. He also called a bear from among the bears.3 The-One-in-the-Sea is named Qinga. And they played with his supernatural beings. So his father became angry. Then he called the Ocean-People. Then the Ocean-People all entered Qinga's house. And a rattle hung there. And his house was filled with a great number of people. Then he took down his rattle.

See p. 304, Footnote 3. He is identified here with The-One-in-the-Sea, the greatest of all the Ocean-

People; but this idea was repudiated by Skidegate informants. 2 This term included, besides the killer-whales, as mentioned in the next sentence, all other supernatural beings supposed to reside in the ocean. The Forest-People are the supernatural beings in the woods. 3 This passage seems to belong on p. 364, at the end of the first paragraph.

Then he sang, Ya hai ye ya haiyi." Qinga sang it. His rattle flew about in the house. Then these people were much frightened. At that time they flowed out into the sea. All of these people went out. And they became stones outside. Then he told them to make a figure of himself. "Make a figure of me," he said. He said it to all the OceanPeople. And they tried to make a figure of him. And they were unsuccessful. Then he began to dislike them. And another made a figure of him. And he, too, was unsuccessful. Then he told Beaver to try it alone. Then he, also, could not accomplish it. And he also asked Porpoise.' But he did it right. And Porpoise made a likeness of him. And he finished it.

Then they set it up. And they called for East. And they called for North. And they also called for West. And they also called for South.' Then they entered his house so as to be shown this thing. Then they looked at it. And East said, "Give it to me." And he would not give it to him. Then North also asked for it. And he would not give it to him either. Then West also asked for it, and he refused to give it to him. Then South asked for it. And he refused to give it to him. Then Deer also entered.

Sdme supernatural being destroyed the uncles of Ashes-Eater. Then AshesEater tried to make himself strong by taking baths. And his friends' wives did not know it. And early in the morning he went shooting. Then he went into the sea again at midnight. He bathed for strength. And in the morning he came in and lay down in the ashes. And his uncles' wives did not know about it, because he wanted to be strong. Only women were left. (The supernatural being) was called Stone-Ribs.3
And when he became very strong, he again went to the Point. Then -he saw eagles come flying from the ocean. And one had a single t!A't!a4 in its talons. They passed it back and forth. They played with it. After they had done this for a time, they lost it downward. And when it fell upon the ground there was a great earthquake. And it sounded as when one fires off a cannon. And being surprised, he went quickly to look at it.

It is thought that when a porpoise is washed ashore, a deer will be washed ashore at the same time. 2 This is evidently a much abbreviated version of the story of Stone-Ribs (see Skidegate Texts, No. 4, in Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of American Ethnology), so altered that the name of the Skidegate hero is now applied to the monster which he overcame. 3 This translation of godAfixe'wiyat is somewhat uncertain, although xE'wi certainly signifies "ribs." 4 Said to be a very small fish resembling a halibut.

And when he was about to cut it up, (something said), "Hn" ("don't"). And when he was again about to cut it up, something again said 'Don't" to him. He did not know what it was that spoke. It was the ground that spoke to him. And another time he was about to cut off its head. A something again said "Hn" to him. And when he was afraid to touch it, he sat over it. And he thought, "I must pull it out by its tail." Then he did so. And when he cut it a little, no one spoke to him. And he pulled out the whole of it. And when he had finished that. he put its skin between some trees. Then he went home. And when evening came, he did not bathe again for strength. And while it was yet dark, he went to (the skin).

When they [indefinite] lived at the mouth of Q!a'nAn River3 a hunter had ten dogs. One day he went out with his people. They went to hunt with the dogs. They also took their sisters. The ground was level. Before they had gone far, his dogs ran after something. And they pursued it. They killed it and lighted a fire, and evening came. They cooked the bear's meat. When it was done, they ate. They were filled. It was fatter than all other black bears. And they did not think much about that. It was different from black bears. Its fur, too, was matted together in strands.4 They did not think about it. Then night fell upon them. They went to bed.

But one said, "Let us first build a fire." And they did as he said. They did not see what they should do, so they lighted a fire. They did it, although they did not want to eat. They did so only to sit near it. Then they did not see how they could get up to the top. They talked about it. And one said, "Let us put a dog into the fire." The others agreed. (One said), "Put the bear-fat into the fire first." And they did as was suggested. Then they put the bear-fat into the fire. It began to burn. But then they tied the legs of one of the dogs. They put him in after it. After he had been consumed, they looked up. They saw the dog walking around the opening above.

"Now let us tie the legs of all of them together," said they. "Now let us treat them in the same way," they said to one another. They caught every one of the dogs. Nine dogs were left. They tied them up, after which they put them into the fire one after the other. As soon as they were burned up, they saw them around the opening above. Then they put all ten into the fire. They saw all around the opening above.

Then he who knew how to hunt with dogs said, "Put me also into the fire." They did to him ais he had said. Although they were fond of him, they obeyed, for they knew they were in the power of the supernatural beings. They put him into the fire as he had asked them. He was consumed. They

Tie me up too. Put me, too, into the fire." And they did just as he told them. They put him into the fire. When he was consumed, all again looked up. Him, too, they saw walk about above, near the one who knew how to hunt with dogs. But then the minds of all of them were happy. They knew they were not going to die. Then another said, "It is not well to tie each other up. It is better that we walk into the fire of our own a,ccord, one after the other." They did as was suggested. They did not tie each other down. They went into the fire, one after the other. All of them ran into the fire, one at a time. And all of them were saved. They were very happy.

They thought, "When we get near the town, they will hear our voices." Therefore they sang. But still their voices were not heard. Then they stopped their headway in front of the town. But still no attention was paid to them. Then they spoke to one. "You better get off. Go and ask why they pay no attention to us," they said to one. So he did. He came up to them. And he questioned them. They did not pay any attention. And when he entered the house, he pushed hard against the door to open it. But still not orie of the people in the house looked towards the door.
He went behind them to the rear of the house. His friends with his wife and the house-chief sat in the rear of the house. He sat down between them. His wife and the house-chief said to each other, "What makes us feel this way?" Then the one who had entered knew that they had become like the supernatural beings. Then he rose and went back. When he got outside, he wept much. And afterwards he went back to where the canoe lay. While he was still walking down some distance away, they questioned him. They said, "Why did they take no notice of us?" So they asked him from the canoe. He said to them, "We have become supernatural beings." Then those in the canoe also knew truly what had happened.

One stood at the bow with a stick to keep it out. The chief said to him, "Push the bow out." He did as he had told him. Still not one went ashore. They said to one another, "Let us try the town again." All said to one another, "Let us go thither again."

Then the canoe had drifted a little to one side. The chief ordered the bowman. He said to him, "Push the bow of the canoe towards the towin." While he was pushing it towards the town in this way, it came in front of the town. But previously they had paddled a long time before reaching it. "Why is it," they said to one another, "that before, we paddled a long time, while now, by just pushing the bow of the canoe towards it, we stand in front of it? In truth, we have now become supernatural beings," they said to one another. They had indeed become supernatural beings. "Now let us name one another," they said to one another. So they were going to say (that is, "do"). "Name the one in the bow first," they said. So they named him. "He shall be called 'Supernatural-Being-who-keepsoff-the-Bow,'" they said. They also started to name the one in the middle. "He shall be called 'Supernatural-Beingwho-bails-out-the-Canoe,' they said.

But after the Canoe-People had named one another, they named one of their sisters. "This one shall be called 'FairWeather-Woman.' One shall also be called 'Cloud-Woman.' One shall be called 'Great-Woman-who-holds-Something-under-her-Blanket.'" Then they ceased naming one another. These are all df their names.' Afterwards they talked over the things for which they had named one another. "You who are Cloud-Woman will be seen when it is going to be calm," they said to Cloud-Woman. She was pleased. "By you, too, FairWeather-Woman, they will look for good weather. By means of you, too, Story-Woman, future generations of people will tell stories," they also said to her. She agreed. "When they call your name, Great-Woman-whoholds-Something-under-her-Blanket, they will always know of you (plural)," they said to her. "You who are at the bow, when another person performs as a shaman, you will mention your name to him. You will say, 'I am SupernaturalBeing-who-keeps-off-the-Bow.'- A shaman will also mention your name, Supernatural Being who bails out theCanoe. You will say to him, 'I am Supernatural Being who bails out theCanoe.' You, too, will say, 'I am one of the Canoe-People.

Then they (the parts) again came together. And he got up again and came to life. And he ate. And after many more days were passed, he again went fishing for things. And he returned again.

They were in fear of some supernatural creatures living there. And, not wanting to be afraid of them, they wanted to kill them. Then they got roots; and when the roots were all ready, all set out. When they had made the roots into a slip-noose, they set out. Then they sat above (the creature). That was Black-Whale.' Then they brought this (noose) to it and put it over its neck. And they pulled it tight to strangle it. Then it (the whale) entered its house with it. Then all took good hold of the roots. Then it broke. And after it had broken, they went to get something else. And they took cedar-limbs. And they took many. Then they took them into the house. And they worked them together in the same way as they had the roots. Then they made a noose and went to (the whale) again. And again they sat above the place where it was. Then it again put its head out of the house. And again they pulled it (the noose) tight about its neck. Then all pulled strongly, and Black-Whale again went into its house, and the cedar-limbs also broke. Then they heard a wren 2 singing.

Cape Qoin and NAst6'.'

Four persons went hunting at night. And the (chief) hunter was named St!a'StA.2 And they stopped under Cape Qon.3 And they heard (the spirit of) the mountain singing, "I am greater. My things are greater than yours. I am greater. My things are greater than I am greater around the whole yours. world." He sang ten songs. And the hunters told how he and NAstW'4 were going to have a propertycontest. And they learned his songs. Three of the men were Eagles. And And he gave some one was a Raven. of the songs to his hunting-companions. And he did not understand what Cape QonT and NAsto' said when they talked with each other. They heard their loud voices. But they did not understand what they said. And after they had come back, they waited expectantly. And before a long time had passed, something made a great noise in the mountain. And a great noise also arose in the house of the other. One morning a noise was heard in the houses of NAst6' and Cape Qoni. And one morning NAStW' gave away ten whales because he was angry. Then Cape Qon also gave away nine whales and a sqagu't in the contest. Then NAst&"s whales floated ashore. And Cape Qoni's also floated ashore. In the language of the Land-Otter-

And when they arrived, they brought (the sea-lion) up. And they brought (it) all in. Then they put stones into the fire for it. And they began to steam it. They brought out three big boxes. And after they had put water into them, they put in the meat and the fat. Then they put stones into them, and when it boiled, they put something over them. Afterwards they went to call the people. Then the town-people all came in. When all got in, the house was filled. Then they took the coverings off. And they put the pieces upon flat boards. And they gave them the meat on sticks. Then they started to eat. And they got through eating. Their brother-inlaw was also with them. They said to him, "Go with us again to-morrow when we go to hunt sea-lion." And he said, "I will indeed go with you." Next day they launched the canoe. And they got into it. There were five of them. There was a man named Go'ttca who was a good carver and painter. Then the canoe went out to (the rock). And it arrived. Then three of them jumped out of the canoe, himself and two of his brothers-in-law. And two staid in the canoe. Then they looked about for a big, fat sea-lion. At that time they killed a very big one. Then they cut it up. And they dragged it into the water. And the two left behind took it into the canoe.

They left him because the waves were big and the wind blew very hard. They tried hard to take him in, but could not. Then they arrived at the town. Then they explained about him. And the people wept very much. The south wind blew for ten days. They thought he had died. He saw how the wind was blowing, but he thought they would come out to take him. He kept looking towards the town. All that time he did not sleep. When it rained, water stood in the small holes on top of the rock, and he drank it with his hands. So he lived. After nine days were passed, the sun shone. Then he provided himself with four ropes. When the sun came out, he went to the sea-lion stomach. And he cleaned it out inside. Then he tied up the lower part with one of the ropes taken from around himself. And he blew it up. After he had blown it up, he also tied the upper part very tight. Then he dried it. He kept turning it over and over in the sunshine. And after it was dried, he took it up. And he placed it near himself against the rock. And in the morning he took it up. Then he laid it down on the edge of the cliff, on the side towards the mainland. And he untied the upper end. Then he entered it. And he tied it up from the inside.

Sometimes he felt he was floating through kelp. But he did not know the nights, because it was always dark oII the inside. When he floated into kelp, he felt something take him away from it. It was a sculpin that took him away. And it took him in its mouth to a place where there was no kelp. He floated about for a long time.

He also said that, before these two killer-whales where created, other sea-creatures, such as porpoises, were made out of spruce and other sorts of wood; and that during the battle with the devil-fish, each family of fishes fought by itself, and the whole inlet was filled with blood. This inlet, he declared, was Gada Bay, which is on the east side of Prince of Wales Island, near Kasaan.

1 This is the story of two hills bearing the above names, of which the latter is near the inner expansion of Masset Inlet, the other, Tow proper, side of Hi-ellen River. Tow Hill is also called "The Little Mountain," and is a very conspicuous object when seen from vessels or canoes passing along the northern coast of Graham Island. Dawson gives the sea-cliff as "composed of columnar volcanic rocks of tertiary age." Its isolated position and character - so out of keeping with its environment, and suggestive rather of the broken western part of the islands - might easily have suggested a myth such as this (cf. Vol. V of this series, p. 21). 2 So the charts, which have imnproperly divided the Haida words Djus qV'li. 3 Haida name of the canoe-passage which runs parallel to the main channel of Masset Inlet for a long distance near its upper end.

Great-Reef and the Son of Cape Ball.2

Great-Reef's 3 daughter married the son of Chief (Cape Ball).4 And after he was married he lived with his father. He lived with his father for a long time. Then his wife wished to see her father. And very many of his father's friends went with him to Great-Reef. And when they entered the harbor, they saw how fine the smoke appeared. He said, "Great-Reef's smoke is good as usual from cut-off wedge-heads." 5 Then they came in front of him, and he came down to his son-in-law. And his daughter's husband went ashore with his wife. And they went up with his father-in-law. On the way she told her father the story. Said she, "Father, my husband said of you, 'As usual, Great-Reef's smoke is good from cut-off wedgeheads.'" Then her father's mind was bad. And he did not give them food because his mind was sick. And he

And there was a big sculpin under the water at the mouth of the harbor. And there was also a big crab by its side. And they (the sculpin and crab) cut them to pieces with their teeth. And they were also pulled to pieces when they passed over the crab. So he (Great-Reef) destroyed them. And part of them were killed by the drying of the ground (being seacreatures).

Then he came to a big cloud rising from the ocean. This was Southeast's house. When he came to him, his daughter was sitting in front of him. And he (North's son) sat beside her. "Where are you going?" said the woman. "I come to marry you," said North's son. And she said to him, "Pray sit here until I tell my mother." Then she entered and told her mother. And she (the mother) told her to call him in. "Let him come in with you," she said. So (the girl) went out and brought him in. Then her parents were very much pleased with them. Afterwards they remained there for a long, time. By and by he told his wife that he wanted to go away. "Go, child! go, child!" said Southeast to his daughter. When they were about to go, he gave his daughter directions. Then he said to her, "Child, when your father-in-law morning

And after they had sat there for a while, he said to his And son, "What does your wife eat?" he had been with his father-in-law, when he had learned what his wife ate. So, when his father asked him, he told him quickly. He said, "She eats nothing but limpets." I So her father-in-law sent to get some for her. IHis house was floored with ice. But still it was warm. In front of his house it was sandy. And there were broad ebb-tide flats. And after she had been there a while, she went out to defecate, and pulled off one of the icicles which hung from the wall of the house. But then her father-in-law groaned. When she went in, she ate it. And when she again went out, she pulled off another. Then her father-in-law again groaned in the house. And when she entered, her husband said to her, "Stop doing so. Those are my father's fingers." And when the tide was out, her husband said to her, "Let us go down and get limpets for you to eat." Then they went out. While they were there, a noise was heard from the direction of her father-in-law's house. He was angry with his son's wife because she pulled off his fingers. The north wind began to blow. Her husband called to her, but she said, "Wait." While she was saying so, the place where she stood became icy. Then the tide was, coming in,

And the cold was so bitter that, where her father-in-law's house stood, the snow looked like smoke. Then she cried to her father. She was not quickly disturbed, because she thought that her father-in-law would save her. When two days were passed, she began to sing. She was suffering from the cold very much. She remembered her father's directions. Her feet were frozen to the ground, so that she was unable to walk. "Father, I am I want cold. Father, I am cold. to go to my father.

The wind blew upon me from Cape St. James, from Point GA'nixet." Then she felt of the water. It was slightly warm. And her father heard her voice. Then he, also, set out to Then he, in turn, see his daughter. dressed himself up. And his daughter While she sang, the was still singing. north wind stopped. Then it blew from the southeast.

there during the night. At that time they took it away and began to bring it up. And they also took it to a pond out upon a point. And they put it into this. They put it upon kelp in the middle of this, and threw it in. And after it had swum about in the water for a while, it came out, got on top of the kelp, and lay down there. Then they took stones and threw them at it. They did not throw straight at it. They only threw near it, because they valued it. The sea-otter was a female. When they threw at it, it got into the sea-water, and swam about there. And when they were about to -go home, they took it with them. Then they went down to the beach to get mussels for it. And they got mussels. Then they broke them. And they gave it the insides of the mussels to eat. It ate notlhing but-mussels. But if they were cooked, it did not eat (them). All that time they made fun of it. Because they made fun of it, two big waves came landward. And when the waves got near shore, the young sea-otter ran in. These two waves came for it. At that time came the flood. Then the people of the town of T!e got into canoes. And the ocean rose very high. And then a little of the top of the mountain was to be seen. That, however, was not covered by the sea. And at that time they came to the dry ground on top of the mountain, and they carried their food and water up there. At that time they built Qx'djlqoku's house first. It was large. All lived in this. But afterwards they began to

And again, after the tide had gone down a little, they went thither. And again they took away mussels. There was nothing visible of (Sisk) but the top, upon which waves were breaking. Then a man came in to Fat-One during the night. This was Sea-OtterMan. He saw that they did not give her mussels. So he married her. At that time they stopped going after mussels.

At that time the south wind was blowing. So the people of the town were very hungry. Then Sea-Otter said to his wife, "Let me go after mussels." She said to her husband, "The waves are bad." She said to him, "You will be dashed against a rock." Then he was exceedingly surprised at his wife's words. "Be dashed to pieces?" he said to his wife. She said this because she was anxious on account of him. He said to his wife, 'I shall not be dashed to pieces." She said to her husband, "It is well. Go for the mussels." Then he said to his wife, "Give me that basket." And she gave it to her husband. Then it was evening. And in the middle of the night he went out. He went out upon the surface of the sea. Then he went down from the top of Sisk. As he swam about under water, he collected mussels. Then his basket became filled with mussels. And he came out. Then he went shoreward upon the surface of the ocean. And he put them down outside. Then he went in to his wife. Then his wife was very happy. Because of the waves she thought he would perish. So she was very glad to see her husband. "But where is the basket?" said she to her husband. He said to his wife, "I put it down outside." She said to her husband, "I will bring it in." "Yes, bring it in," said he to her. Then his wife went out. And she saw it outside some distance from the doorway. Then she went to it. The basket was not large. It was filled with mussels. Then she took it by the handle.

He said to his wife, "Give .some of this to all your friends." She did so. "And put those into the fire. When they are cooked, eat them," he said to his wife. But he did not eat what was cooked. Next night he went out for mussels again. Then he again went out upon the surface of the ocean. Then he again dived under the breakers. At that time he again went about under the sea and got mussels. And again his basket was filled. When it was full, he came up again. At that timne he again walked upon the surface of this ocean. When he had walked up to the town, he again set it down in front outside. And he again told his wife to bring it in. Then she took it where it stood outside. But then it was not heavy. Then she entered the house with it. He said to her, "Give this to all of your friends." So she did. He said to her, "Put some of the mussels into the fire." Then she lighted the fire. And she gave the "roe" l to her husband. He alone got mussels for the whole town. They thought it was this woman who did it. At that time they questioned her. "One has married me,"

she told her friends. They said to her, "Who has married you?" She said, "My husband perhaps belongs to the OceanPeople.' But afterwards she told them about her husband. She said, "I have married Sea-Otter-Man." At that time they came to know that she was married. Then two went to see him. They saw the one who had married her. And their minds were very happy over it. Then his wife became pregnant. Many days passed during her pregnancy. At that time she wanted to scratch her thigh. Then she kept scratching it. She did so for two days. And a child came from her thigh. It was a boy. All that time her husband got mussels for the town-people. Then he (the boy) became larger. When he had become a little larger, she again became pregnant. And after many more days had passed, she gave birth from her thigh. It was a girl. She, too, became larger. Then she again became pregnant. Then she again gave birth from her thigh. She had only three children. Then a small bird flew about above the town. When it flew over them, its wings made a humming noise. At that time the woman was sitting outside. And when it again flapped towards her from a distance, and flew over her, she took a stick lying near by. And she struck it. Then the stick just touched it. When it touched, it gave back a ringing sound. And she looked at the end of the stick. And the end of it had changed to copper. Then she took it off. And she

Then his mother said to him, "What do you want it for?" His mother also valued it. He said to mother, "Do you value it?" And his his mother said she valued it. "No," he said to his mother, "give it to me." Then she finally gave it to him. At that time he pressed it on a stone. He worked it into a bow. And he also pressed out part for arrows. And he finished them. Then he went into the woods. He shot nothing but flickers. And he shot ten. And he tied them together by the necks. Next day he again went thither. And ne again shot ten. And again he came home with them. Then his mother took off the skins. And she dried all of them.
And next day he started off again. Then, however, he saw very many of them. And he shot many. He put them on his back. Then his sisters skinned them. And they skinned all for him. And his father hung them up in the house inside. And he dried all. Then they sewed them together. And they made four blankets. At that time he gave one to the sister who was born next after himself. And he also gave one to the youngest.
After he had given these to his sisters, Sea-Otter said to his children, "Now, children, I am going to leave you." He said to his children, "Before I go, I will give you instructions." At the time when he was about to go

At that time, however, she called in her friends. And they entered the house. Then they gave her friends directions. They (the town-people) said to them, "What are you going to do?" They said, "We shall sit under water at the mouth of Q!a'nAn River."' Then their mother said to them, "This one shall be called Woman-with-whom-theyhave-a-Smooth-Sea. This one shall be named, Cumulus-Cloud-Woman. I, too, shall be called Fine-Weather-Woman," said their mother. The boy's name was Always-jumping-about-in-Water.

i6. A Second Story of T!E.'

When people lived at the town of T!E,2 they played with a certain thing. They played with that only. They played skisqaona'io.3 They wanted to see who would win. They made marks on two sides. He who sent the skisqaona'nio beyond the mark was made master over those playing on the opposite side. Again they placed the ball in the middle. And they struck it from opposite sides. The one towards whom it was struck, they did not have strike again. They took the other. But he towards whom the ball was not struck was kept for it (perhaps as chief). This is the way they played every day. At that time they did not know any other game, therefore they always played it.
The town-people did not visit in other people's houses. So they did not know one another. This was the Thereway with the ancient people. fore they did not know one another. So they did not know one another during the game. One day a certain person won many times. Then those who could ruin fast got ready for him. Again he ran with the ball. And when he drew near the goal, one of the fast runners caught He pushed him. His up with him. marten-skin blanket lay over his head. Then the players all looked towards

him. Then they saw that his back was as if covered with chiton shells lying over one another. And they laughed together. As they laughed, all clapped their hands very much.

Then the chief's son was so much ashamed that he continued to lie there. They were frightened at him, because his vertebrax were not like those of a human being. Then all stood in front of the houses. Then all the town-people watched to see whither he went. While they were watching, the tide came up to him. It came near him. At that time the town-people did not know who he was. Then all looked fixedly at him. Then the tide came near him, because there was a flat stretch in front of this town. Therefore it came across it rapidly. While they looked at him, the tide reached him. Then it came over him. That was the last they saw of him.
And afterwards the tide did not fall quickly. Althotugh these people very much wanted to play ball, there was no place where they could do it, because the tide did not fall quickly. While they waited, night fell. Very early next day they heard a drumming-sound out at sea. All awoke quickly. All of them listened. Immediately they were disturbed. Before they got tired of waiting, they saw a wind rising. They saw that this wind was not like an ordinary wind. The waves out at sea were white. When they (the waves) came near them, they saw that this was foam. And they thought nothing of it. Then

But at that time they blamed one another, because they did not see how they could save their small children. Just so the foam came over some of the children who could not run fast. But they were better able to run for safety with the stronger ones. Not long afterward others became tired. The foam also overwhelmed them. Those still stronger were also still better able to run for safety. Before they had gone far, they said to one another, "There is no way to save our children." And they said to one another, "Now let us leave all of our children behind." And as they had said to one another, so they did. When they left them, they wept.

people listened to his words. When he got through speaking to them, they said to him all together, "You speak truly."
Now, all believed it was the son of The-One-in-the-Sea, for who else would have foam come for him in that way? Then all said, "Now, when we want things, we will ask him in prayer." At that time they made prayers to stones. They also mentioned the names of points in prayer. So that is the way they made their arrangements. They said to one another, "Now it is all right."
But when they got through speaking, the women went out of doors to weep. And when they thought of their children and of how they had died, their minds were very sick. When,they heard their wives speak of their children, their husbands also began to cry all together. They were unable to talk plainly to one another. They went to bed crying, without having eaten anything. Next day, when it -was light, they went out. They started back to the same place. There was not a single breaker to be seen. Before they had gone far, they came upon the dead bodies of their children, whom they had left, lying dead below. Then the women and the men all began weeping together. They finished weeping.

Afterwards they remained for a while in that place, because they had not yet properly cared for their dead children. Afterwards they put them into the boxes. And they finished.

But after that they started off. Again (lower down) they came to the dead bodies of those they had abandoned. Then they wept all together as they had done before. After they were through weeping, they again remained at this place for a while. Then they again made grave-boxes. They put their dead children into them. They finished this. Next day they started on again. They came to the others they had abandoned. Again the men and the women wept before them as they had done in the presence of the others. They finished weeping. And afterwards they gathered their children together. Again they told one another to make coffins for them: And they put them into these. This was completed. They made all good in the three places where they had left them. Next day they again started away from that place. Then they came again to their own town of T!e. At that time there was not one house to be seen standing there. Then, too, they were very sad, because they remembered the former times, when they had played there and their houses had been good. Again they remembered the many children they had had. So they again wept bitterly.
When they stopped crying, the chief of the town called them. His name was Qa'djiqok'. He was town-chief at that time. So they obeyed him. Then he told them how they were to build the houses. "Do not build my house first. I want you to finish yours first," said he to his town-people. Then all

And he again took salmon. And he went back. And when the Eagle saw the canoe pass, it called. And he gave it two salmon. Then he started away. And they (the people) became very angry with him on account of it.- They say he secretly left salmon for it. They say he got salmon for it. Every time he caught salnon, he left it some.

And they said of this child, "He has no food to eat because he gave his food to the Eagle. He is hungry because he used to give the Eagle food." And when the Eagle called again, he went over. And when he came below it, a whole spring salmon lay there. And he put it into the canoe. Next day it again called, and he went to it. A whale-jaw lay under it. Then he cut it up. And he put it into the canoe. And he did not give any to them (the people). Next day it again called. A whale's tail lay beneath it. And he put it into the water. Then he tied a rope to it. Then he began to tow it. And he put it in front of the place where his grandmother lived. And he tied it there. Next day it called again. And a whale was below it. Then he put it into the sea. And he towed it. And he put it in front of the place where his grandmother lived. And he tied it. Every day a whale lay, beneath it. And he came to have ten. And he secured them all.

Then he called all of his uncles for it. And all came to him. And their wives also came. And all their sons' wives were there. And all the men were there. Then he gave five whales to his uncles. And they cut them up. And he also called people from a town far up the river. And all came.

And the chief of these was named XA'd-ogaqAs. Then all those people cut up whales. And XA'd6gaqAs had a daughter. And he married her. Then they also cut up whales. And when they were cut up, they went away with them. And at that time he went with his father-in-law. After he had been there for a while, he wanted to go to his father's town. Then his father-in-law gave him a copper. And his motherin-law also went with him. His motherin-law had a labret. And there is a mountain called Qadja'ni.1 And a mountain-goat stood on the top of this mountain. Then he shot it with a sling. And when he became ashamed,2 he went into the sea along with his wife. And they became stones. The end.

I On the south side of Nass Inlet. It was from the spirit of this mountain, according to the Skidegate story, that Raven obtained the sun, moon, and olachen. 2 I took this story down directly from the story-teller, and it is possible that I may have left out something, as the connection between the death of this mountain-goat and his shame does not seem clear. 3 A much longer story bearing the same name may be found in the Skidegate Series of stories (Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of Ethnology, p. 2IO). The present tale resembles that only in the latter portion, where Many-Ledges' daughter returns to her father, walking on the surface of the ocean. In all other particulars it is similar to the story of The-One-who-got-Power-from-his-Little-Finger, with which the story bearing this title was probably confused. 4 An old town in Naden Harbor.

mother went thither. And she spoke to his father. He said to her, 'Is he a shaman?" Then he called him. At that time very many shamans were seated at the upper end of the house. Then, when his grandmother told him, he dressed himself up. And he went thither. And his beating-boards went in before him of themselves. They were carved like land-otters. Then he performed around his uncle's son, who was sick. Then the bone he had caused to fly by blowing upon it stuck out of his (the sick man's) side. He pulled out his bone from it a little. Then he (the sick man) did not groan. And when he ceased to perform, he shoved it in again. Then (the patient) began to groan again. When he stopped performing, he pushed it in again. The house was filled with shamans who had been employed. At that time they had given him some of the property given to shamans. When they gave him all of the property that is given to shamans, he pulled out the bone. And (the sick one) was healed. Then he went to his grandmother. And his uncle gave him all of his slaves and all of his coppers. Then he entered his grandmother's house. And he said to his grandmother, "In the night do not look up." So in the night his house was creaking. Then day broke. And his house stood there large. And he had many slaves in it. And he also had many coppers in

It said to him, "Where are you going?" - 'I am going to marry the daughter of Many-Ledges." And it said to him, "When you come to the end of a mountain which shuts its mouth, spit this medicine upon it." And after he had gone along for a while, he saw a big mountain closing its mouth. And he came to it. Then he spit the medicine upon it. Then it died. But then he climbed on top of it. After he had gone along for a while (longer), the land again split in front of him. And he spit medicine upon it. And when it closed, he went over it. After he had gone along some distance farther, he came to ground that was burning. And he again spit medicine upon it. And it was quenched. *And he went over it. After he had gone along for a while from that place, he came to where he (Many-Ledges) lived. And he heard them chopping something behind his house. Then he went over and came close to it. Still they did not see him. It was (caused by) the slaves (of ManyLedges). At that time one broke his stone axe. Then he heard them talking. Then they were afraid of what ManyLedges would say. Then there was no way apparent by which he could get into the house, because his house was of rock. Then he went back. And when he came down on the beach, he found a knot lying there.

And he started thither. And a stick for killing devilfish lay in one corner of the house. He took it. And he came to it (the devilfish). Then he spit medicine upon it. And it died. And he pulled it out with this devil-fish-stick. Then he carried it off on the end of the stick and laid it in front of the house. Then her father began to groan, because (the young man) had destroyed his supernatural powers. "The skins of my supernatural powers," (her father) said. And (the young man) entirely destroyed his (father-in-law's) supernatural powers. And he was the only one who brought his wife water. And after he had brought it, he placed it before her. And she dipped a feather into it. Then she looked at the water dripping off from it. When it dripped off well, she drank. Then the man wanted to return. So next day he and his wife started. And they walked upon the surface of the ocean. And he came to the place where he had formerly lived. He came to it with his wife. Then he and his wife entered the house. And his grandmother was glad to see hiis wife. Then he alone always went for water for his wife. Then she said to her husband, "Do not speak to the women sitting along the edge of the creek."

Then he saw a woman waiting for him near the edge of the creek.And he spoke to her. The woman spoke to him. And he answered. Then he set the pail before his wife. And his wife, as before, dipped a feather into it. And after she had dipped it in and pulled it out again, his wife saw that the water was slimy. Then she did not ask anything of her husband. At that time she was going to go to her father. And she said to her husband, "Do not come with me." Then his wife went out. She walked upon the surface of the ocean. And her husband went with her. Then he also went upon the surface of the sea after his wife. And after she had gone along for a while, she said to her husband, "Turn back, lest I look at you." But still he walked after his wife. Then she looked round towards her husband. And there was a hole right under him in the sea. And he fell into it. Then she made a mark with her finger above her hu'sband, right over him, on the sea, and started away from her husband. And she came to her father's house. And when she entered, her father asked her, "Where is your husband, child?" And she said to her father, "He came with me, and when I looked towards him he fell into the sea." Then he commanded his slaves to get his son-in-law's bones. So they went and got them. They reached them, took his bones, and picked all of them

I 9. The Sleep-Power.

The chief of the town of Gitadji' 2 was named DjagAmsi'tkas. And one of the people in this town was a good hunter. He shot hair-seal all the time, as well as other fur-bearing animals, land-otter and marten, deer and black bear. And when he went out again, he did the same thing. Every day and every night he did the same thing. And his canoe was always full. And on no day did he come back with an empty canoe. By and by he went to hunt again, and came back with an empty canoe. He did not shoot the smallest thing. And by and by he again went to hunt. And again he came home with an empty canoe. And again he did not shoot the smallest thing. Every day he went hunting, and shot nothing each time. He did this for a long time. Something began to tell him. Therefore he was like this. When he was unable to kill anything, his friends talked about it much.3 And after he had wondered at himself for many days, he staid at home, because he had killed nothing. He was surprised.

And he went off again during the night, while it was very calm. And he went far beyond the places where he used to kill things. And since it was too far to return, he began to collect shell-fish. He was going to camp for the night. He had not taken food with him. And in the evening he hunted for a good place. After they (he and his steersman) had found a good place, they landed there. And they took their shell-fish up to the woods. And they lighted a fire with a drill. And they put much wood on the fire. And when it burned well, they cooked their shell-fish. When it was done, they began to eat. And one of them went to get the bailer. And when they got through eating, they drew up their canoe. And they went to sleep. And when they went to bed, he said, "Did something perhaps tell of us, that we should kill nothing to-morrow?" And in the morning, while it was yet dark, they launclhed their canoe. And they went back to the place where they used to kill things. And again they killed nothing. And they arrived near the town, having killed nothing. And while they were still a little distance from the town, evening came. And their canoe was still empty. He had not shot the smallest thing.

After he had wept there for a long time, he cried himself into a different condition. And right there he turned into stone. And his wife became stone under water. And now the stone is named White-Stone.1 And when people came down from above, and came to this woman, they put their labrets into the sea. Then their canoes did not go down into the sea also. When they did not give her their labrets, she took their canoes. By and by a current came up boiling, and their canoes stood up straight and went down. But when they gave her their labrets, their canoes did not go down. The end.

A big spider lived in front of 2 Tow Hill.3 And when a person passed below, it let itself down to him. And it seized and ate him. It did this for a long time. And when they became afraid of it, they passed around behind. And they began to dislike it. And two mischievous' persons wanted to kill it. One was named L!1'yAm, and the other was named K!oan. And they sharpened a stick at both ends to kill it. And they told their friends beforehand that they were going to kill it. Then all of them watched them, and they went to it.

And when it swallowed him, he put the stick crosswise in its mouth. It was unable to bite. And while it was trying to get hold of him, they shot it with arrows. They also speared it with war-spears. And they killed it. And they cut its belly open. And they took human bones out of it. And a bird also used to kill the peoplo at night. Then these two, L!I'yAm and K!oan, wanted to see the bird also. And they wanted to kill it with bows and arrows, because they had heard that it killed people.

At 0ai'in2 were two towns. On the side towards 0a'lgAm "'lived the RearTown-People4 and the Tcats-GitAns.' The Ski'daoqao6 and Sadju'gal la'nas7 also lived there. And they took salmon in the stream, And a certain man was always with them. He went up to get salmon with them every morning. For a long time he was a human being, just like us. When they did not take much salmon, they spent the night there. They spent the night at Xwa.8 And when they roasted the salmon, he always took the roe. After they had been up there two days, they would come down. And they were going up to K!A'sin.9 They 1 on foot to were going up to QEk!a get cohoes. They left the canoe below at K!A'sin. And after three days had passed, they got back to the town. They also took salmon from Xwa. All that time the man was with them. And when they made a fire and roasted

roe. His mind became a little different. So he ate nothing but raw roe. And one time they went up to get salmon. There were three men in the canoe. He was also with them. And when they were about to go down, the man said, "You go down alone. I shall remain here." He said, "I will get salmon for you." And next day they were troubled about him, and soon went up to him. And they came up to K!A'sin. And he was not to be seen there. Then they hunted far upward to Rapids. And before they hunted for him, they saw that his mind had become different. And after they had obtained a great deal of salmon, they went down again, because they had given him up. The two towns wanted very much to see him. Still they did not see him. Every time they spent the night in the river-valley, they wanted to see him. By and by a canoe was at Xwa. While they caught salmon, their blankets were at the place where they had made a fire. Their mats and their food were also there. And without being seen, he took all of their food away. And they did not know about it. Nor did they see his body. They knew that he did it. In this way he took away all of their things that he saw. He made them tired. They did not like his actions. They did not like finding their things gone. He kept doing that way. Hie took the property of both towns in the same way. Then they hunted for him. And they saw that he had made a fire. And they did not go to him. They

only looked at him secretly fromn a distance, because they were afraid of him. But he did not see them in hiis turn. And as he stood around the fire, he said to himself, "Come-Out, take that." So he spoke to himself. So he did go and take it. Then they heard him name himself Come-Out. Although he was alone, he told himself to do things. Wherever along the valley of the stream they did things, he came out there: so he called himself Come-Out. He lived about all the time in the woods. When his friends heard him call himself Come-Out, they called him nothing but Come-Out. Before that time, they did not know his name. And again for a very long time they did not see him. Then they again saw him. And he acted in the same way as before. And when he walked around the fire, he said to himself, "Give that to me, Come-Out." Then he went to it and gave it to himself. He liked his name. Therefore he always spoke so. Then they knew that he had become one of the supernatural beings. And he made things in imitation of the things that human beings make. And he constructed a salmon-trap in a little rill. He did not stay near it. He wandered about far off from it. And presently, when they went up to "ai'in Lake to get something, they saw what he was doing. And as soon as they saw it, they knew that it was he who was doing so, because not one person lived at "ai'in Lake. And when they came back, they said to their friends, "We saw Come-Out's fish-trap, but we did not see his body."

And Come-Out came down below near the stream above QWk!a. And he sat upon the face of a steep place. The hither side was steep, and the farther side was very steep. And he saw bears come out on the side opposite him. He looked across and saw them from the opposite side. Ten black bears came down the face of the steep place, one after the other. And when they got near the stream, they stood still. Then the leader looked back towards them. And he acted as if talking. And a water-hole on one side of the stream was full of cohoes. And when one (salmon) floated down a little from the shoal, the bear bit it. It was the leader (of the bears) who tried to find one floating down. And he killed it. And he gave it to the one who stood next. And he, in turn, gave it to the one who stood next him. And he, also, did the same thing. Another did in the same way. And they gave it to the one who stood last (at the end of the line). And he tried to find another. And when it got a little below the rest, he bit it. And he gave it to the one standing near him. And they did the same *to this as to the former one. And they gave it to the next one. Then he tried to find another. And he killed another. And he gave it to the one who stood next.

And after he had killed nine, he looked up towards his friends. And he acted as if speaking. And when he tried to get another, he bit it for

When they saw that he had bitten it, they returned upon the trail. Each mouth was full. Leaving cohoes still there, they went up. After the bears had gone up, ComeOut went across to view the place, because he was surprised. And he looked at the place. He went down upon the bear-trail. And he saw the place whence the bears took salmon. And he also saw that there were many cohoes in the pool. And when one of them floated below, he killed it, as the bears had done.

When he got back to the place where he used to make a fire, he again made a fire. And the two men watched him secretly. And when his fire was kindled, he said to himself, "Come-Out, cut the salmon open. This is Bears'Pool salmon," he said to himself. And when he had it cut up, he said to himself, "Roast it quickly on sticks. ComeOut is very hungry." And as he was cooking it, "Leave the inside raw," he said. He did so. He said, "Come-Out, pull out the sticks quickly." After he was through eating, he said, "ComeOut, are you still hungry?" - "I am full, Come-Out," said he to himself. All that time the people looking at him secretly, heard what he said. They were afraid to go to him, because he had become like a supernatural being. He said to himself, "Come-Out, go to another place." So he started. Then the two persons went down from him. And the people wanted to see the place whence he carried up cohoes. And they saw that the beartrail went straight down to it. They heard him call it Bears'-Pool. And the two men also saw it, a pool small and round. It was full of cohoes. Not a single person knew of it. Bears only knew it. From Come-Out they knew that its name was Bears'-Pool.

SkA'ndal went fishing with (the people) from Wi'dja.3 And they continued to fish. They made hooks and let them down into the sea. And the halibut ate all of the bait. And the fish did not bite SkA'ndal's hook for a long time. And after he had fished for a while, he had a bite. When he had drawn the halibut near him, they said to him, "SkA'ndal, lie in the water with it." ["Lie in the water with it" means "Be very careful."] Then SkA'ndal lay down in the water with it. And his friends rescued him. And after they had come from fishing, and had lived there for a while, they went fishing again. And they again stopped where they used to fish. And they again put their hooks into the sea. And all caught halibut. He did not have a bite. And (they said), "SkA'ndal, clean your hooks. You do not get bites because your hooks are dirty." So he pulled them up. And he felt they were slightly heavy. And when he pulled them up, he looked down at them. And there was something big on one hook. And he pulled it into the canoe. And the one who sat opposite him said to him, "What is it, SkA'ndal?" "Ai'ya, I do not know," he said. All in the canoe said to him, "It is an abelone." 4 And the one who sat next

I The man who takes literally every metaphorical expression has been a favorite story-subject among civilized people, and it is interesting to find it, as in this story, also among people on the cultural level of the Haida. 2 He is said to have belonged to the Sqoa'1adas, a Raven family more numerous at Skidegate than at Masset. 3 A town on the northern coast of Graham Island, between Masset Inlet and Virago Sound. 4 See p. 313, Footnote I.

Then he dropped his hook into the sea, and began to catch halibut. At that time they did not say anything to him, because they knew that he had gone into the water to lie with his hook before. And after they had fished a while, they again began to look at his abelone. They were pleased to look at it. Abelones were difficult to find. And after they had looked at it, they put it before him. Then he took it up and threw it into the water. He said, "Wa-a, they tire me out handling it. There it will also belong to me." They returned. After they had entered the house, they told about it. They said, "SkA'ndal pulled up an abelone, and he threw it into the water." Then many people were sorry for it, because abelones were very valuable. And after they had lived there for a while, he went to look for things on the beach. "Where areyougoing, SkA'ndal?" they said to him. "If you find a whale, carve it all up." And he said, "Yes." And when he started, he went a long way. And he came to where a whale lay. Then he began to carve its skin only. Hie carved all sorts of figures upon it. And he carved the whole of it. And he went back. And when he came home, they said to him, "Did you, find a whale?" "I found one," he said. "Did you carve.

Then all laughed heartily. They said of him, "This SkA'ndal is a peculiar man." And next day, after they had cut the whale up, they went to get it. And after they had the whale in the house, they went to get fern-roots for it. Then they dug a hole in the ground and put stones into it. Before they put their fern-roots into it, the woinen seated themselves around it. A woman said, "I will lie here."' And SkA'ndal said the same. He said, "Here I will lie." And all put their fern-roots into it. Then SkA'ndal also lay down in it while the steam was rising. They did not see him. Then they put the mat-coverings over it. They also put ashes upon it. They also put cold sand over it. And they made a big fire over it. The fire was laid over it all night. And when the sand began to get hot, something inside burst. Ho," they said, "SkA'ndal's heart is burst by the fire." They had their faces painted red because they wanted the fern-roots to be red. Next day they got up very early. And they took the ashes away.

28. The Woman in the Moon.

At Long-Town in Nass Inlet lived a woman named T!a'djigAs. Water leaked through upon her. All that time she pointed her fingers (in derision). And, although the sun shone, water kept dripping upon her. Here, too, water always dripped upon her. And at daybreak she went out. When she sat outside, water kept dripping upon her. Meanwhile she was pointing her fingers at a star. She always pointed her fingers at it. And this star was right over her. Then something pulled her up. And far up (in the sky) she saw a big house standing. And they placed her on top of the house, in the smoke-hole. And there there was a great fire built. And when she was in this fire, she cried out. And her brothers heard her. Then something was made like a human being. One of her brothers made it. He made it to resemble his sister. And when her brother had completed it, he took it up to her. And he made this stand in the fire on top of the house. And this also made

And they finished it. And when it was finished, they took it up. And they placed it And their sister on top of the house. was still crying on account of the fire. Then they put it on top of this house. And it also cried there. Then they took their sister away. And, although that (imnage) was made of wood, it cried out in pain.
Then their sister was not to be seen. At that time they (the stars) went down after her. Then (the brothers) poured out some red paint. And while (the stars) were taking this, (the brothers) got far away. (The stars) picked up all this red paint. Then they again pursued them hotly. They again approached them. Then (the brothers) again poured red paint out. And (the stars) were delayed by it. Meanwhile they got far away. There was a great crowd of people, (who) gave up (the pursuit) when the red paint gave out. Then they came to Long-Town. At that time they told about the AboveCountry. Some time afterward she was playing with her brothers. She played all the time they were there. Then she pointed her fingers up at the moon. She used to do so when she went after

But he did not spend his father's property. He became crazy. At that time there were no mosquitoes. Then his father said to him, "Child, eat medicine." He refused. He did not understand that (his father) said this in order that he might win in gambling. He again went to GamblingTown to gamble. All of the people of that town gambled. Therefore it was called Gambling-Town. They did not eat halibut there. The Inlet-MiddleTown-People' lived there. And he gambled there. He gambled with SI'nat. And the town-chief was named SkA'miAn.

Then his father was fishing in the lake (the inlet) with nets. He was fishing for dog-fish. .When he dropped the net. he fastened stones on both ends. And it sank. And although the water was very deep where he was fishing, he refused food.1 Next day he went to get his net, and took it into the canoe. And there were several dog-fish in it. Then he went away. When he got back, he took the net out of his canoe. And his wife took up the dog-fish. Then his wife took the dog-fish-livers out. And after she had taken them into the house, she put stones into the fire. When the stones were hot, she put the box near the fire. Into this she put the livers. Then she put the stones into it. When (the water) boiled, she placed something over it; and after it had remained for a while, she took the cover off. And the oil was done. And when it was cold she offered it to her son. But after he came back from gambling, he began to fast. When he refused the oil, his mother said to him, "Son, what is the matter with you?" He said, "To-morrow I shall go out to eat medicine." -"Where will you go?" she said to him. Then he launched his canoe. After he had launched it, his father came to him.

said his father to him. He said to his father, " I shall go to Xa'lAn-sL!UN." He wore a ragged marten-skin blanket. When he reached that place, he went up to the woods. When he got far into the woods, something before him made a noise. The voice was not like that of a bird. Following it, he came to a narrow trail. He went along this, and came to a pond. When he reached it, a log was there with the top cut off and a nest made of moss at the end of it. This was a quiet place. And there were nests near one another in the moss near this lake. Then he sat down near by. While he was looking at the moss hanging from the branches of the trees above him, a long, thin bird flew out. It flew straight towards him. It made a noise like "M-m." It had a long bill. And it sat on the moss nest on the end of the log. This was the place where it sat. It was its nest. This was Mosquito. The inside of its nest was green. Then he went to look for a stick for it. And he broke off a stick with his feet. Its bill was upon the moss. Then he walked to it upon the log. He walked slowly to it. He held the stick in his hand. When he got near, he struck it. When he struck it, he saw that it was dead. And he took it out. It was light. Just as he turned around with it, a humming-sound arose on the other side. "Hm-m," it sounded. Mosquitoes came out from inside of the moss. Those were the small ones like ashes. What he had come to was a Mosquito-Town. And the moss formed the nests of the mosquitoes.

Then they bit the man. And he did not abandon his mosquito. He ran very fast. And all went after him. The mother of the mosquitoes was called Hwa. When he got far from the lake, he knew that they were following him for that, and he tore it in pieces. After he had torn it in pieces, he scattered it about. He said, "You will bite even the last generation of people." Because he tore it in pieces, the big ones came to be in the world. Then he escaped to his canoe. Then he went to his father. His face was unrecognizable. His ears and all his skin were swollen. Blood, too, was thick upon his face. So his father did not at once recognize him. When he did so, he said to his son, "Is it you, child?" - "It is I," he said. Then his father asked him to take medicine. And he refused. Then they put down marten-skins, and blackbear-skins, and he lay upon them. Then he was better. At that time, his father said to him, "Stop gambling, my son." So he did. He stopped. Then (he said) he was going to trap marten. HIe deceived his father, for he was not going to do so. He said to his son, "Go in this direction." And he started off. When he got far up the inlet, he could not see the land (i. e., he lost his eyesight). And after he had paddled about at random for a while, he ran into the shore. Then he crawled to the bow and got out of the canoe. And he crawled up to the woods. When he got far into the woods, his arm was seized. He felt himself being led along by some one who said nothing.

Then he (the person) said to him, "Now I will let you go. When people call out to you, say, 'Yes!' Even the last generation of people who shall say 'Yes' when you call out shall die." It was the spirit of that place that spoke to him, the mountain-spirit. And he never came back. He said to him, "You shall be called Always-Calling," and he let him go. Now he is called Always-Calling. He lives only in the forest. He lives for human beings. When he calls to a person and he (the person) replies "Yes," he dies. But when he says, "Yes, yes, yes, yes," he does not die. If he says, " Yes" once, however, he dies. The end.

3O. The Origin of Carved House-Posts.

Many people lived in the town of Gi tAn-q!a-ld'na.1 The east wind blew so strongly that some of the houses were blown down. So they did not care to live there. They went away. And they came to live at Delkatla.' Then there was no salt water there. It was all covered with grass. Then they dug the town-chief's house-hole. They finished his first. And all of the people lived in his house. But afterwards they built houses on either side of him. All of these houses were completed. Then all began to live in their own. One autumn after that, they went to Rose Spit to get food in two big

And they completed them. There were two. Then they began to paint them. Then they raised them on something. At that time this land moved. The Ocean-People2 were angry on account of it.

They also ptit them into the ears of their wives and children. Then they sang. They sang crying-songs. They sang for themselves, because they thought this would not again dry up. At that time they sang the following crying-song. "The supernatural beings were the ones who made the flood come. The supernatural beings were the ones who made the flood come, made the flood come." At that time the sea began to move. The canoes be.gan to sink. And after the canoes had sunk, they (the people) floated upon the ocean. Now they became birds. For that purpose the canoes sank under the sea. The OceanPeople were the ones who caused it. But after that, the tide began to fall. And now they are birds. Part of these birds are called EarRing-Wearers.' The Ear-Ring-Wearers were once people. And they say that the house-post is now upon Gao.2 People used to see it there when they went up to eat medicine. Moss grows upon it. Those who were going to be chiefs kicked off the moss from it. When one saw it, he became rich. Near it stands a very big devil's-club. And the chief's house-hole still forms a hole in the sea. When the tide is low, it is still seen. And they also used to pray to the house-post to become wealthy. Those who prayed did become wealthy. I1 Some kind of sea-bird, unidentified. sea-bird, unidentified.

At the town of Lq'na-qons2 lived a certain child. He was- foolish. His grandmother was foolish like him. And the people went away from them to the mouth of the Skeena. Hlis grandmother had a stone axe. His uncle's daughter left a piece of salmon secretly. She also left some live coals in a shell. As soon as all had left him, they collected pieces of cedar-bark. And they built a house. And it was completed. Then he made a fire with the live coals his uncle's daughter had left him. When the fire was kindled, his grandmother took part of the salmon. She broke this in pieces, and they ate the bits. And they ate all. Next day, when the tide was out, his grandmother went down on the beach to dig clams. And she put the clams into a small basket. When it was full, she went up. Then they put them into a fire her grandson had built for her. When they were cooked, they ate. When she did this for the second time, he said to his grandmiother, "Is the stone axe good?" She said to him, "It is good, son." And he said to her, "Bring it to me." Then she gave it to him. Then he went to look for a stone, and found a flat stone. And he brought it into the house. Then he said to his grandmother, "Give me And she gave him water some water." in a tray.

At that time he found the handle of a stone axe. Then he entered, and tied on the handle. And he completed it. Then he was very fond of it. He did not think of anything else. At that time he said to his grandmother, "Are there any cedars growing in the woods?" - "Yes, child, go inland by that short point. A cedar is growing there," his grandmother said to him. So he went up. And when he went up to the cedar, several good cedars stood there. And he began to cut one. Ai4d he cut it down. When it was cut down, he cut it off four fathoms long. He did this to make it into a canoe. Then he cut it out on the upper side. He also made wedges for it. He made many wedges. In the evening he went home. When he was going home, he came to a big skunk-cabbage. And he dug a trench around it in readiness for the time when he should be thirsty. Then he went on, and entered (the house). And his grandmother dug clams for him. And she gave him cooked ones. Next day he went out again. He went along until he came to the skunkcabbage. And in the trench he had dug around it was a salmon. It was a sockeye salmon. And he threw it up. He clubbed it to death, and put something over it to cover it up. Then he went to his canoe. And he worked upon his canoe. And after he had

Then his grandmother cut it up. He said to his grandmother, "Hang it up." And she hung up half. They ate half only. And they went to bed. Next day he went up again.

After he had made it larger, he took the salmon. He also carried the plank along with him. And he came home. And he gave the salmon to his grandmother. Then he began to split the plank in order to hang up the salmon. When he had finished, he put the pieces up high. Then his grandmother hung (the salmon) on them.

He came up to the skunk-cabbage. Then there were five more salmon in (the trench). He threw those out also. When he had clubbed them to death, he covered them over. Then he went to his canoe.

Their house was very full. But then he did not go up. He did not know what had done this. At that time he began to make a bow. When his bow was finished, he also began to make arrows. After he had worked for a while, he had a great pile on the ground. During this time he did not go up to see the skunk-cabbage. And he said to his grandmother, "Hide yourself in a corner. I, too, will sit here." And he also hung a mat in front of himself. His grandmother hid herself in a corner. And he put a great many arrows and his bow near himself. He put wood into the fire. Then evening came. And he sat behind the mat. While he sat there, a person entered through the doorway. He had a big stomach. His legs were small. His fingers, too, were slender.

She took the skins from them. His grandmother dried these skins. And they slept. All that time the eagle sat there, and kept calling. And he said to his grandmother, "Grandmother, let me put this grouse below the eagle." "All right, child, give it food," she said to her grandson. And he took it thither. After he had left it there, he went away. And he entered the house. It was evening. Next day he again went to the woods to look for birds. But then he got only a few. That time he did not see a grouse. After he had shot them and come back, he gave them to his grandmother. And his grandmother took the skins off, and dried them. They steamed the meat. And they ate.
Next day he went up to the woods again. And he did not see any small birds. He thought he would see some by and by. And he came home without them. And their meat was gone. But then he told his grandmother to sew these skins together. He told her to make blankets of them. Next day he again went to the woods. But at that time he went far into the forest. Then again he saw nothing. Then his heart was tired. And he again came home with nothing. No food was to be seen. They fasted five days. Then the eagle called from far off.

It brought this food to him from Sqax. And a whole hairseal lay there. And he took it. And he threw it down in the house. Then his grandmother cut it up. She put it into small boxes. Next day it again called there, and he went out. When he' got below it, it flew away. And there were two hair-seals there. And he put one on his shoulder, and laid it in the house. He also took the other. And he brought it home. And she cut it up. In the evening they went to bed; and when morning came, it called there again,

But they did not eat this. When night came, they went to bed. Very early next day the eagle called there again. But this time it was a whole (whale). And he kicked it down into the water. And he towed it in. And he anchored it. Every morning (the eagle) gave him one. And they got ten black whales. At that time he remembered what the Artisans had said to him. And he said to his grandmother, "The chief of the Artisans told me, if there was a slight noise in the house at night, not to look up." Thus he spoke to his grandmother. And when evening came. they went to bed. And in the night their house shook. And they did not look up. And in the morning their house-front was painted. The Artisans had done it. Then he constructed a big platform over the beach on which to lounge. And this was finished. And he wore the bird-skins one over another. His grandmother sewed them. And he sat upon the platform. He also gave one (blanket) to his grandmother. While he sat there, hie saw a small canoe with two people in it come from the mouth of the Skeena. When it got below him, (it proved to be) his uncle's slave. (The slave's) wife and clhild were also with him. And he called to his grandmother. "Grandmother, some slaves are coming," said he to his grandmother. So thev called to them, and let them come into the house.

The (slave's) child was old enough to eat. And he said to (the slave's wife), "When you go away, do not take hair-seal for the child." And when her child cried, she suckled it. And she threw a thick piece of hair-seal down inside of her clothing in front. The slave did so, because the food was all gone at the mouth of the Skeena. And when they were through eating, she (the grandmother) took the tray away from them at once. And she did not give them the few bits of meat that were in it. They did not want them to take what was left over. And (the slaves) left. He said to them, "Do not tell the people about me." And they got home during the night. At that time there was a little fire in the house. They arrived when all were in bed. Then these slaves warmed themselves by the fire. After they had warmed themselves, they went to bed. And when they were in bed, (the woman) let her child suck the fat of the hair-seal. And it slipped down from his hand. And the child cried for it. "Fat, fat!" it said. Then its mother tried to find it. And she could not find it. Then her master heard what the child said.

Each put two martenskin blankets on his daughter's back. And they made them sit up high. They thought he would marry their daughters. Then they came to the place where he lived. At that time he was sitting outside, on the platform. He looked at them for some time. And they landed on the one side of him and on the other. Then he paid no attention to them. Last of all came the father of the one who had left him live-coals and the salmon. And his canoe came to land far off from him. And he said to his grandmother, "Let him land right below." And his grandmother went thither. And while they were still in the canoe, she came to them. Then she said to them, "Come ashore in front of us." And they went there. And while they were still coming to land, he (the boy) went down to them. And while the young girl was still in the canoe, he took her by the hand. He said to her, "Come ashore, so that I may marry you." And she entered the house with him. Then all saw him. He married her because she left the live-coals and the salmon. Then his grandmother cooked hairseal for her. He let his wife eat first before the great feast he was going to make. After she was through eating, he told his grandmother to call the young men.

He borrowed ten empty boxes from the people. While it was boiling, they went to call the people. He called husbands, wives, and children. He called all, because they were very hungry. When this was cooked, all came in. And his house was filled. Then they brought trays for it. They were told to give them nothing but big trays. The stewards brought out the trays. And they placed the trays in front of them. And they began to put the whale into these trays. They also put grease into them. After they were through eating, he said to them, "You chiefs, take all of the whales. Divide them among you." Only to his fatherin-law he gave a whole one. So all the chiefs took them. They divided one between two. And they all took it all away. And they made him townchief. Then they questioned him. They said to him, "How did you kill the whales?" - "I gave grouse to an eagle.

Then she again went to the town, and walked about in the town. She walked about everywhere. And as she wandered about, she began to weep.

They (the people) will not stay with you during the night, said he to her. And he went away. And during the night, noises arose around her. And as he had told her, she did not look up. And when there were noises around her, she did not sleep any more. And when she knew it was daybreak, the noises ceased. The noise stopped just at daybreak. And she had not yet looked up. And when it became light, the Artisan came. And he took the blankets from her head. He said to her, "Are you still asleep?" Then this woman looked up. And she saw that she was in a big house. The whole house was completed. A fire also burned in it. Food, too, was in it. There were many different kinds of food in it. All kinds of things were in it. The Artisan helped her. He was a carver.

And tell your brothers about yourself. And when they enter the house, give them food. Then they will find out about you," said the Artisan to her. Then she went to her brothers. She put off the things she was wearing, and put on other clothes. And she came to her friends. Then she called for her brothers, her father, and her mother. Before she went to her friends, her husband said to her, " We are not going to stay here. We shall go to another country. Therefore it is well for you to see your friends." Then all came. And she gave them food. And she said to her friends, "The man who stays with me says he is going to another country with me. Therefore he told me to come and see you before I go." And her husband had said to her, "Do not tell your friends how I made this house." When the woman called her friends, the Artisan did not stay in it. He did not wish to show himself to the people. And when her friends left her, it was evening. Then he again said to his wife, "During this night, too, I shall not sleep with you. If there is a noise around you, do not look up. Keep blankets wrapped around your face all night," said he to her. And although she knew it was morning, she kept the blankets wrapped

Origin of the Spear and the Killer-Whale Crest, and of Carving.'

There was a mischievous child at the town of Da'fiAngun.2 His name was YO4naha'o. Then he always made fun of the children, although he was small. After he had done so for a while, he called ten children to himself. He led the ten children to the other side of the town. And there were many bones there belonging to a body that had been burned, and coals. When he came there, he told them to sit in a row. Then he took a flat stone for the charcoal. Then he took a piece of charcoal and softened it upon the stone. And he called for one of them. "Let that one come here," he said to him. And he went to him. And he sat near him. And after he

And he raised his head. And he painted his face with charcoal. And after he had finished painting him, he told him to sit where he had sat before. He painted the faces of all the children. After he had painted them all, he said to them, "Stand up." So all stood up. "Stand in a straight line." So they stood in a straight line. Thein he said to them, "Take hold of one another's hands." So they did. Then he took the hand of the foremost. And he led them over the trail to the town. When they reached the town, he said to them, " Come out between these houses. Sit down in front of the chief's house. Turn your faces towards the house, so that they can see you." But he was not with them. He staid behind the houses. And he ran to his grandmother behind the houses. He lived with his grandmother at the end of the town. And when he got into his grandmother's house, he lay down. While he lay there, (he heard people) talking in the middle of the town. Then he said to his grandmother, "Go out. See what they are talking about far off there." Then his grandmother went out. And she went thither. Outside there was a great crowd. And there they talked much. His grandmother heard them questioning their children. "Who did this to you?" they said. They, said to their

After they had dived and been under water a while, they came up. They did not stray everywhere. They were in one place. So he began to think about them. Then he questioned his grandmother. "What shall I do to get them?" he said. "Well, child, let me make a slip-knot trap for them," his grandmother said to him. His grandmother (also) said to him, "Get hemlock-roots, for they are strong." And his grandmother took the hemlock-roots. And his grandmother made a snare for him. And the birds flew away.

And so he did. But then he spoke to his grandmother. "Shall I not put stones into the fire?" rhus he said to his grandmother. The bird was-very fat. So he put stones into the fire. And the stones became hot. After the stones had become heated, his grandmother began to pour water into a box. Then she put the meat into it. After she had cut it up, she put the hot stones into it. When it boiled, she put small mats over it. When it boiled, he said to his grandmother, "Shall I not call the chiefs?" And his grandmother said to him, "Yes, child." So he made a feast. He went to call all of the chiefs. And he called the people in the end house. Then they questioned him. They said to him, " Who calls us?" He said of himself, "Y1etna'o calls."

They put the trays on their knees. After he had given dishes to all those in the house, he began to give to those outside. But theirs he set before them. After he had finished giving to them, he took away the mats. Then he put the meat into a large tray. Then he put the tray on his shoulder. Then he put a small piece of meat into each of their trays.

Then the woman told her father. Her father said to her, "All right, child, tell your husband to go hunting." So he went to hunt. There were four in the canoe. During the night he harpooned hair-seal. By doing this he filled the canoe with hair-seal. In the morning he went back. He arrived at the town. Then they brought the hair-seal into the house. At that time he said to his wife, "Tell your father to cook all of the hair-seal. And tell him to call the people for the food." So she told her father. And they cooked them. When all were cooked, he called the people. Then they all came into the house. Then they began to set trays in front of them. And they began to put the hair-seal into the trays. And all the trays were full. After they had eaten there for a while, they got through. Afterwards all carried off their trays on their shoulders. Five nights afterward he went to hunt again.

Four nights after"lard he went hunting again. But then he went at night. As he was going along in his canoe during the night, (he heard) a hair-seal snoring upon a reef. When he came close, he speared one lying on top. It was as if one threw at a stone. It was not a hair-seal. It was a carved post. And he got off to feel of it. "Come and feel of this thing. It is a carved object," he said to those in the canoe. And they also got off for it. And they felt of it. When he speared it, their hunting-spear had broken in two. Then the bow-man said, "Let us take it into the canoe." This rock stood half out of water far out at sea. Then they tried to lift it, and were unable. Although it was small, it was very heavy. And they could not do it at all. And they went home. And passing along, they arrived there. They killed nothing. And when they arrived, they told about it.

It is significant that the figures represented give the animal and the human side of their most popular deities. 3 This peculiar and interesting story is evidently connected with the first meeting with white people.

wind blew from the north. They were almost saved. They were blown very near a reef lying there. The reef is called Crab.' They were driven seaward a whole month and a half. They had much water in their canoe and a square box full of food. After the month and a half was expired, they came in sight of land. And next day they were blown to the land. There was a great crowd of people there. Their upper parts (perhaps coats) were red. Then they let them (Eagle and his wife) live there with themselves. Then they gave them a small house. They were very fond of (ki'nd to) them. And they (the strangers) had not thought that there was any land here. They asked them, "Is there land there (beyond the ocean)?" They continually gave food to them. "There is land there," said (Eagle). And there was a cave there. This was full of birds. They told them to watch these. rhe lowest row around the inside was composed of wrens. Above them sat humming-birds. Above these sat bees.2 And above these, again, sat Wa'nuga. In this (cave) it was always warm. So' the summer birds lived there. While they were there, five years passed. Meanwhile their friends hunted for them. They did not know where (Eagle) was. They hunted in vain where he used to go to dry salmon. His friends wept continually for him. At the end of four years, the Wa'nuiga disappeared. They came across hither. Ten days afterward, the humI Said to be so named from its shape.

Is your land where the sun comes up?' And he answered, "Yes." - "To-morrow go home," they said to him. Then they launched his canoe. Then they put water into it for (the travellers). They also put food into it for them. Then they (Eagle and his wife) went straight towards sunrise. They went for five days. The land that they left disappeared. Then they did not see how they should go, because no land was in sight. Then a small gull flew around above them. After it had flown around for a while, it sat on the bow.

After ten days were passed, the surface of the sea was clear. Then evening came upon them. At that time it sat about in their canoe during the night. When ten days were passed, the top of a mountain appeared a little. But then this sea-gull flew away from them. Then (Eagle) called to the killerwhales. He called because he saw land. Then they saw the top of Hippa Island. At that time they poured their fresh water into the sea. He (the man) poured this water in for Raven-Fin.' Afterwards he also called for Noisy-Fin.' After he had spoken, something beneath him made a noise. Then they saw two killer-whales swimming in the sea. He said to them, "Save me!" They did not paddle. Then their dorsal fins came up on both sides of him. Then he said to his wife, "Go to the stern." So his wife did go to the stern. And he also went to the bow. Then he put his arm around the dorsal fin of one of them. He also seized the other. "Save me," he said. Then those killerwhales started off. Raven-Fin and Noisy-Fin went.

They came to fight the Rear-Town-People.3 When (the Ninstints-People) saw them, they went back. They landed alongside of them. And five men went over to see them. Two had war-spears. And they came behind them. Then they looked at them stealthily. Then the wife was not to be seen near the fire. She had been drying by the fire the copper box in which they got food, and which had become wet through. At that time the man was beating upon this with his hand. He made a drumming noise. Then some of them said, "Now." But when they did not see his wife, some said, "Wait until his wife comes." - "No," they said, "go out and take him." His wife was in the woods after water. During that time, they came to take her husband. She saw them kill her husband. And that night she went up into the woods. And they cut her husband's head off. And they got into the canoe. Hiding themselves, they passed in front of Swamp-Town. Then the woman came to SwampTown. And she entered the chief's house. This chief was named He-whobecame-the-Elder.

And after he had seated himself near by, he said to him, "Bring your wedges here." And he spit medicine upon them. It was Heron's medicine. And the wedges became whole. And after (the slave) was through splitting his wood, he said to (Nanasl'mgit), "When I bundle up the wood, get inside. And I will carry the bundle into the house. Then I shall go out for water. When I come in from getting it, I shall make myself fall into the fire. Then you must be quick. After this is poured into (the fire), and the house has become dark, run in and get your wife. After you have run out with your wife, I will get stuck in the door." So the slave carried in the wood on his shoulders. And he (Nanasl'mgit) was inside of it. And (the slave) put it down in the house. At once he picked up the bucket. The bucket was a big one. (The people carried such only on their shoulders.) And he came back from getting the water. And he got into the house. Then he made himself stumble. When he fell, the water ran into the fire. Then (Nanasi'mgIt) ran in and got his wife. And he ran out with her. And the slave made himself stick in the doorway. While he was stuck in the doorway, (Nanasi'mgIt) got far off with his wife. And (the people) ran after him. And when they had almost overtaken him, he threw down some of the hair-combings. He got far away, while the land became covered with bushes.

And while they tied it up again, part of them went off. Then they started on again. And as soon as they began to move, her basket-strap gave way again. And again some of them went on. After they had tied her strap together, they started on again. It again gave way. At that time, only her father's slave remained with her. And after they had tied it together and set out, it again gave way. Then her father's slave went away. They did not know that it was the BearPeople who broke her string. After (the slave) had gone from her, two men came to her. Then they said to her, "Come with us." Then one carried her basket. And they put her between them. And they went off with her. After they had gone along for a while with her, they came to a town. They came to a Bear-Town. After she had staid there for a while, evening came, and they went out to get food. And they went off at midnight. When she first got there, a woman was seated in the corner. Pitch was running all over her arms. With this pitch she was stuck to the ground. And the woman (just abducted) was going to get firewood. The Bears left one man with her to keep watch over her. Then the woman (in the corner) said to her, "They do not get dry things.

When (the Bears) had almost reached home, she lighted it. And when they came, they shook themselves near the fire, and took their skins off. And they hung them up. After she had combed her hair as directed, she gathered the combings together. And she looked carefully after the hair-oil. She also took a whetstone. She also took red ochre. At midnight of the following night, all came back from getting food. Afterwards she again began gathering food together. All that time, the man watched her closely. And when he again went with her to get wood, she piled a lot of wood Then upon him, and tied the bundle. she took a little and ran to the house with it. She threw it down outside, and went in to get the hair-oil, haircombings, and the whetstone. She also took red ochre with her. Then she ran away with these things. After she had gone on for a while, the one who watched her came and called out. After she had run on for a while longer, she heard them making a great noise in pursuit. When they got very close to her, she poured out some of the hair-oil. Then this hairoil became a big lake. And after she had run on a while longer, she broke off a piece of the whetstone. And it became a big mountain. That time, after she had run on for some distance, snow-birds 1 almost surrounded her,

when she poured out some red ochre. Then the birds all went back to it. And they put it on their faces. And after she had run on a while longer, and they had almost overtaken her, she threw down some of the haircombings. And they became a mass of fallen trees. And while all struggled through the middle of these, she ran on again. Meanwhile she got a long distance away. And after she had run on for some time, and they had almost overtaken her, she broke off part of the whetstone, and stuck it in the ground. And while they were trying to find a way over this, she ran away. And after they had again gotten a long distance ahead, and they had almost caught up with her, she threw down some of the hair-combings. Then there were again great masses of fallen trees there. After she had run on a while longer, they nearly overtook her again. Then she stuck the whole comb into the ground. "Become a mountain," she said. And it became a big mountain. And since they could not cross it, she ran away from them. After she had run on for a while longer, and the birds had nearly come up with her again, she poured out all of the red paint. Then she again ran along while they painted themselves. And when they had nearly overtaken her again, she stuck the remainder of the whetstone into the ground. And it became a big mountain. And after she had gone on a while longer, they nearly overtook her again. Then she poured out all the rest of the hair-oil.

At that time she ran out at the shore of the sea, and a man went about in a canoe in front of her. And when she got behind him, she said to him, "Let me go with you." Then he paid no attention to her. Then she said to him again, "Let me go with you. And I will marry you," she said to him. And when those behind came near her, he said to her, "Get in with me." Then he came to land below (the place) where she stood. At that time he said to her, "Get in." And she got in, and he went seaward with her. At that time the Bears came out after her in a crowd. And after they had remained on the shore for a while, they swam towards them (the man and the woman). And when they came around them, he put a carved club he owned into the water. And this club killed the Bears of itself. It clubbed them to death. And it clubbed all to death. Then this woman looked out. He told her to hold her face down. And when they were all dead, he said to her, "Look out." So she looked out. Then she saw the dead bodies of the Bears floating on the ocean and on the shore also. Then he said to her, "Hold your head down again." So the woman held her head down. After she had held her head down for a while, she felt a snake pass around her waist. At that time this woman threw her blanket off, and shouted with fear.

This thing that took her in was XA'nL!dAn.' The snake was his right arm. Then he said to her, "You said you would let me marry you." Then he told her to put her head down again. After she had held it down for a while, she felt a frog go around her waist. But then she paid no attention to it. At that time she lay without speaking. When she looked out, she saw the one who had taken her in sitting near her. He was spearing hair-seal. And after he had filled the canoe, he went home. And he said to his wife, "When the woman in the house to whom I bring you steams hair-seal and eats it while I am again away getting things, do not look out at her." And they arrived home. And his wife came down to the beach to him. Then she was very much pleased with the woman he had brought home. And they entered the house. And after they had been in the house for a while, evening came, and early next day her husband went to get food. During that time, (his first wife) steamed this hair-seal. When she cooked this, (the new wife) only listened to her. When she ate, she blew out the bones, but (the new wife) heard only the noise they made against the house. But when she felt that (the old wife) was through eating, she got up. And when she also was through eating, her husband came in from getting food. And he again brought home a hair-seal.

Then (the old wife)took up the whole of the hair-seal, and put it into her mouth head first. Then she sucked it all in, and blew out the bones only. And (the new wife) looked at her secretly. This was Finger-Nail-Woman. Her finger-nails were very long. And when she knew that (the new wife) was secretly observing her, (Finger-NailWoman) turned around to her and began to scratch her to pieces. And she threw her outside. And after the man had staid away for a while, he came home. And when he went up, he saw the flesh of the woman he had married lying around outside. And being sorry on account of her death, he became angry with the woman he had first married. Then he had a coat of red-cod skin into which he entered. Then he clubbed his wife and cut her in two. And after he had cut her in two, although the portions were far from each other, she put herself togethler. After that, he again clubbed her and cut her in two. Then she again put herself together. When he cut her in two again, he took out a whetstone. Then he put it between the portions. And when she ground herself upon this, she ground herself up. Thus he killed her. Then he took the flesh of the one whom she had killed, which lay about outside, into the house. And when he had put her together, he spit medicine upon her. Then she revived, and he married her for good. After they had lived together for a

Then he went away. And he arrived at the town. And they asked him, "Where is your daughter?" - "She disappeared while we slept. We do not know what happened to her." Two years afterward he went to live there again. At that time he also had his four dogs. And the day after he arrived, he started for his mountain. And his dogs went with him.

When he came to the mountain, his dogs barked at something. And he came to the object that his dogs were barking at. When he got there, they threw him into the house (or den). The Grisly-Bear-People were the ones that did it. A great crowd of GrislyBear-People lived in this den. And his daughter had married among the Grisly-Bear-People. His daughter was in there, so they did not kill him. Instead, they were kind to him. At that time his daughter spoke to him. She said to her father, "Father, stop killing grisly bears. Do not kill a single grisly bear. They took you because they are afraid of you. Now they tell you to go away. Remain in your canoe at the end of this trail," she said to him. Then he set out. And his wife was seated in the house. And he said to his wife, "My child has married a GrislyBear." Thus he spoke to his wife. "They told me to stay over there in my canoe to-morrow." And the next day he started across. Then he stopped there. They brought two big animals for him. These were mountain-goats. His sonin-law killed mountain-goats for him. And they put them into his canoe.

The day after, he started to see his children-in-law. Then his childrenin-law kept meat for him. And his daughter had a child. It was a girl. She had a child by the Grisly-Bear. It was grown up. (The woman's) father called for her child. And the GrislyBear would not let his child go. "Wait till she has grown up," said the GrislyBear of his child. Then his son-in-law carried down meat for (the man). And (the man) took the meat into the canoe. Then he came back to his wife. Then he told his wife that his daughter had a child. He said to his wife, "I asked for (the child). Its father would not let it come." Then his wife (said), "When you go thither again, I will go with you." So, when her husband started thither, she went with him. And they arrived there. Then they went to the entrance of the den. Then he came to his son-in-law with his wife. And they let them enter the house. At that time, she saw her daughter's child. And the grandmother called it to her. Then it went to its grandmother. And she held (the child) in her arms. And it licked its grandmother. And when she held it in her arms, she asked it to come along with her. Then its father was unwilling. Therefore it did not go with her. Then they went away. At that time they put plenty of meat outside for (the grandfather). And they went home.

And they put the meat into his house. And he held a feast with it. Then all got into the house. Then he gave this meat to them. At that time he told them that his daughter had a child. And they asked him, "Did you not ask her to come with you?" - "Yes, I called for her, and her father would not let her come," said he. " If a Grisly-Bear comes, do not kill him, because (one of them) married my child." Therefore (the Grisly-Bears) did not kill the townpeople. Some time afterward he went there again. And he came into his (smoke) house. And the day after, he again started to see his son-in-law. And he came there. Then his son-in-law told him this news. "My child is married," said he to his father-in-law. And he said, "Where?" He said, "My child is married among the WolfPeople." - Can I go to her?" his father-in-law said to him. "No," he said, "it is a distant country." So he did not set out for it. At that time his son-in-law again gave him plenty of meat. And his son-in-law carried this meat down for him. And he put it into the canoe. And he said to him, " Cease coming to see us." Therefore he stopped going to visit his son-in-law. The end.

38. The Man who became an Eagle.

A shaman lived at Spa-6's.' His nephew was very foolish. Every morning his uncle spoke to him to correct him. He was foolish from the time when he was a yourng man. He grew up this way. Then he (his! uncle) had a box made for him. And it was completed. And they put him into it. Then they put a cover over it. And they made the cover strong. Then they took a canoe. And they put this (box) into it. And they went far out to sea with it. Then they put it into the sea. And they went away from him. Then he floated about on the ocean for many days. And after many days had passed, he felt that he had floated ashore. -While he was there, he heard people talking. Two [own] sisters were talking to each other. The younger saw (the box) first. Afterwards the elder one found it. Then they ran to it. And when they seized it, and moved it about, they found that it was very heavy. Then the elder said she had found it first. But the younger one said, "I found it first." Still the elder one lied to her sister. Then they rolled it up to the woods. When they got it near the woods, they took off the cover. Then they saw a person lying inside. And then they pulled him out. And they led him towards the woods. "Sit here," they said to him. Then they went to tell their father about him. And when they ran in through the doorway, their father questioned them. "Why do you

And they led him away. And after they had led him into the house, their father said to the man, "Marry my youngest daughter." And he married her. And he thought that the daughter he had married was a human being also. He lived there a long time with him (his father-in-law). By and by his sonin-law said (to his wife), "Tell your father that I want to see my father and my uncle's town." Thus he spoke to his wife. (Her father) said, "Bring me the box yonder." They brought it to him. Then he removed the cover. This box was full. It was fuill of eagleskins pulled off without having been torn up. Then they began to take the skins out. There were many with white tails. There were also many without white tails. One among them was spotted. He said to his son-inlaw, "This one is all right. This one is spotted." He used to wear it when he killed whales. And he gave it to his son-in-law. He was very fond of that one. Then (the young man) went into it. He went out of the house with it on. When he tried to fly with it, he flew straight at once. He flew above the mountains. Then he sat at the end of the town upon a tree. And the children playing saw him.

When it fell, he flew away. And he sat upon another one, some distance away. They began chopping on this one as well. When this started to fall, he flew away. They wanted him, because he was spotted. Then their hearts became weary. Then he flew to his uncle's town. He sat there. He saw the children playing about everywhere. And when they saw him, they told about him. The whole town wanted to see him. Then a great crowd of them came beneath him. At that time, he tried to find his uncle among them. And (his uncle) came long after the crowd. When he got among them, (the eagle) flew down quickly to his uncle. And he carried him away in his talons. He caught him by his matted shaman's hair. At the time he was lifted up, some one seized his feet. When this one was also lifted up, another person seized his feet. They seized one another's feet one after another as they went up, until he carried away the whole town. Then he flew towards the sea with them. As they had thrown him far out into the sea, he also threw them into the sea. But he still carried his uncle along. And he flew along in search of a steep place. He threw him into the ocean below this. He said to him, "The last generation of people shall see you." So he became a devil-fish. All were human beings,

Then he wanted to catch a whale, as his grandfather did. His wife told this to her father. Then her father said, "Do not let him catch one with two blow-holes. Let him catch one with a single blow-hole." Thus he spoke to her. And then (the young man) went out again and entered his skin.' He looked about upon the ocean. At that time many whales came landward. His father-in-law told him not to catch one with two blow-holes. Then he flew out to them. But he did differently from the way his father-in-law told him. He seized the one with two blow-holes. And it went down with him. Only the tip of his wing was to be seen. Then another flew to him. And this one seized the tip of his wing. This one, too, nearly went under. And after another had put on his skin, he flew out. And he seized the end of the wing. The people of the town all seized the ends of one another's wings. And all the people were gone. One old person was left. Then the end of one person's wing stuck out of the sea. At that time the old man also dressed himself. Then he also flew out.

Land-Otter-Woman and her husband came to Land-Otter-Town.1 And they were there two nights. Human beings were afraid to stay there. And while they slept, the Land-Otter-People carried off the woman's yellow-cedar-bark blanket.' And when morning came, they discovered that it was gone. And as (the man) hunted about, the woman wept. They heard (the Land-Otter) saying, "Wxa, wxa!"3 in the woods. Still she was afraid to go up and look at them. The people were playing with her yellow-cedar-bark blanket. So they made a noise together. And they also heard some one singing there. The song was like this. "Ha! yellowcedar-bark blanket. Ho! yellow-cedarbark blanket. The yellow-cedar-bark blanket is gone in the morning. Ho! yellow-cedar-bark blanket. Ho! yellowcedar-bark blanket. The yellow-cedarbark blanket is gone in the morning. Ho! yellow-cedar-bark blanket." Then they went up to see them. Then they looked at them stealthily. And the Land-Otters stopped playing with her yellow-cedar-bark blanket. And the Land-Otter-People went away. But they did not know whither the Land-Otters had gone. And they also came down to the canoe. And when they had got down, they went away. And they went over to the other

I The songs so called were obtained from a Jesuit upon the Skeena, long before there was a Protestant station at Masset. The people danced, and sang these songs, for six days, resting upon the seventh. They also put food, clothing, etc., upon the roof for a time, as a kind of sacrifice, and touched their foreheads and breasts, "like the Catholics." 2 See Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, p.

And next day he went to look at it again. And after he had fastened his canoe, he went to the fish-trap. And when he looked at his fish-trap, he did not see any salmon in it again. Then he examined his fish-trap again. And he saw that it had a hole in it. And before he mended it, he wanted to examine the footprints of the creature that caused it. And he saw footprints of the black bear. And he again went to his fish-trap. He said, "How those eaters of raw flesh break through my fish-trap!"' Then he strengthened it and went home. And he used bad words to them. He knew they were black bears. And next day he went thither again. And he again fastened his canoe. And again he went up to his fish-trap. And before he looked at his fish-trap, two persons came to him. And they wore small bear-skins as blankets. Their cheeks were also blackish. They were very fine-looking men. And they calledto him. They said to him, "Go with us." They said to him, "We come from a very good town." And he went -with them. HIe went with them to a very far land, but the trail was very good. And when he had become tired out walking, they came to a big lake. And he saw a town upon the other side. He looked across. The smoke

And they put salmon upon his heart.2 "Do you feel it, you who said that we eat raw things?" they said to him. And when he got up, they placed salmon in front of him, and he ate it. He was there all winter. And during the night the Bear-People all went hunting. And a certain woman She was half stone. was in the house. She was not a bear. She was a human being like us. Then she called the man. She said to him, "Chief, come here. When you go to get wood, do not get dry stuff. Get wet things." And when he went to get things, he got only wet stuff. And when they returned in the evening, they made a fire. And his was kindled. And in the evening, just before all returned, he made a fire. Then they came out of their skins. And they became like lhuman beings. And they hung up their skins in the house. And he watched them do this way for a long time. And he also got firewood for them.

Then he (the man) ran off with his skin. And the woman had given him haircombings. And she also gave him a liquid. "When you see all coming very near you, throw down some of this, and the land will be full of fallen trees. And when they come near you again, pour part of this -upon the ground," she said to him. Then he ran from the town with the chiefs skin. And they followed him in crowds. And the chief was with them. And when they got near him, he threw part of the hair-combings behind him. Then the country became covered with fallen trees. And the Bears were unable to go through them. While they were there, he got far ahead. And when they got near him again, he poured out part of the liquid. And there was a big lake behind him. And while they went around this, he got far away from them again. And they again came near him. Then he again threw down the hair-combings. Then the land again became covered with fallen trees. And again he ran away from them. Then they again came close upon him. And he poured out all of the liquid. And another big lake came into existence behind him. And while they were running around the lake, he got to his canoe. And his canoe was still there. Then he threw his bear-skin into the canoe. And he went away in haste with it.

And after he got well out to sea, the Bear came down running. He was like a human being and said to him, "Give me my skin." And while he was speaking, he began to melt. But his skin in the canoe grew. And he made himself melt. But his skin became a whole bear in the canoe. And he came to the town with it. Then his friends were very much pleased to see him. They thought he was dead. Then he cooked the bear-meat. And when it was cooked, he called the people for the food. Then all entered his house. And he put it before them. And while they were eating, he told them about himself. And when they were through eating, they left him and went home. And all got into their houses. And not many days afterwards they received news. They said that the Black-Bear-People, the Grisly-Bear-People, the Beaver-People, the Wolf-People, and the Deer-People were going to make war on human beings. Then the people built a stockade. And they made ten rows around the fort. And it was completed. And when the fort was finished, the animals came to war. All the animals came. And they tried to overthrow the fort. And they pulled the stockades over with their teeth. And the human beings also shot the animals with their arrows. And they killed them. And the animals did not kill a single person.

41. Qa'k!a.
Qa'k!a lived at Sitka. He had two wives. One was young. The other was old. And he went with them to an uninhabited place to camp. And hecamped in a lonely place. He loved the young one. His mind was sick of the old one. After he had lived in this uninhabited place for a time, his (elder) wife looked through his hair (for lice). Then his wife said to him, "The things you are wearing in your ears are dirty." Her husband wore red things in his ears. Then she pulled them out, and put others in. She twisted sinews of the land-otter tail around them. She did this because she was vexed with her husband because he loved the young wife. After he had lived there for a while, he went after cedar-bark. After he had gone into the forest for some distance, he got the cedar-bark. And he tied it up. Then he started back with it. After he had gone along for a while, his young wife came to him bearing cedar-bark. "Where are you going?" said his young wife to him. He said to his wife, "I am going towards the sea." - "You are going towards the forest, but I am going towards the sea," said she to her husband. And she said to her husband, "Come this way." Then her husband went to her. And then he went with her. All the time, he carried the cedar-bark around on his shoulders.

He thought it was his wife. So he went with her. He did not know that he was going up into the forest. Then he felt strange, and threw the cedarbark away. Then he kept on going with her. At that time he knew that something else had taken him. After she had walked with him for a while, they came to a town. And he entered the house with her. At that time he saw one of his aunts in the house. Then his aunt said to him, "Although I am living uncomfortably here, you must come too." 1 He had come to a Land-Otter-Town. The Land-Otter had made herself look like his wife. Then his aunt spoke to him again. "Qd'k!a, your old wife put a land-otter sinew into your ear. That is why they took you," she said. And at night, when it was near morning, they again went to get food. Then he used to get firewood for them. And he used to get water-soaked wood. As soon as he had gotten it into the house, he put it into the fire. And it did not burn. When he had piled a great deal in, he put in pitch-wood to start it. And his aunt said to him, "When you get wood, do not get dry things. When I got wood for them, I got nothing but dry wood. And when they came in from getting wood, and all shook themselves, the fire went out.,* On that' account they treat me very badly. They fasten me down with pitch. Part of me is also stone," she said. When they had almost reached home, he started the fire. When the pitchwood he had put into it began to burn,

the Land-Otter-People began coming. Then they shook themselves. After they had taken out the things they had, they spoke. "This is Q!d'diya sculpin; this is Tc!a'gwals 2 sculpin," they said. And after they had cooked this, he ate .with them. And it was hard for him to take the bones out of it. Also, when night came and he went to bed, it was difficult for him to lie down, because he had to lie between the roots. And just before dawn, they again went after food. At that time he again carried home water-soaked firewood. And as soon as he had brought it home, he piled it up in the fireplace. And again he put pitch into it in readiness for their return home. So, when they came home, he started to burn it. And when all got in, they shook themselves. And his fires never went out. So they were very much attached to him. In the evening, when they went to bed, he also went to bed. And it was very hard for him to lie down, because there were so many roots. There were roots across his ribs and across his neck. When morning dawned, they went after food again. All that time he carried up wood for them. When they had almost reached home, he set it on fire. All that time he never went

that they were carrying him. Next day, however, he began to find out that they were taking him. And after he had gone on for a while, they arrived. And they entered the chief's house. And after they had given him food there, night came, and they went to bed. The next morning he looked up, and those who had been with him were nowhere to be seen. Then he knew what they had done to him. They had given him to the father of a girl some one wanted to marry. And when they left him with the chief, they married the chief's daughter in exchange. And in that house also lived one of his aunts. His aunt said to him, "Although they ill-use me, you muot come here as well." l This aunt was also held down with pitch. Part of her, too, was stone. And after he had been there for a while, they took him away. Because his aunt used to get nothing but dry wood, part of her had been turned into stone. Then they went away with him. And they landed him at Yd'xda.' And when they landed there, another of his aunts was in this house also. She had two husbands. One of these was old. The other was young. Then his aunt spoke to him. "Why does Qdfk!a go about as he used to do?" she said to him. And after he had been there for a while, she said to him, "Your aunts' husbands are going to take you home."

And they started away from the place. Then they came to the camp at Cape Charcon.1 After they had landed there, they lighted a fire for him. And they left him. And when they were going away from him, they said to him, "Do not peer after us." And after he had sat near the fire for a while, he ran after them. And he looked at them stealthily. And when they felt that he was looking at them, he ran back. And he sat down again near the fire. They saw that he was foolish. And when the Land-Otters had come back, they said to him, "You looked at us stealthily. Do not do so again." And when evening came, they started off with him again. And after they had gone along a while with him during the night, they came under W!'lga.2 After they had lifted their canoe high on the beach, they again lighted a fire for him. And they again started away from him. But at that time he did not look at them stealthily. And when they came back, and it was evening, they went away again. And they travelled all night. In the' morning they landed under Sitting-Grisly-Bear.3 And after they had lighted a fire for him, they went away to roll (as landotters do). And they again came back.

All this time this man Qa'k!a never looked out. When it was almost day, they landed again. They landed opposite Point SI'k!a.1 And they again went away to roll. And when they came back, they camped during the day. There there is a great stretch of open sea. They looked for fine weather there for a long time, because the sea was wide. Presently, when the wind was going to be good, they prepared to go. They said to him, "While we are going, do not look out." So, when they went, they covered him up. And they went across in the night. And as they paddled rapidly, he listened to their voices. And wanting to see them, he looked out. Then the one in the stern made a noise with his nose, when he knew that Qa'k!a had looked out. At that time he panted with the exertion. Then the tide set against them. And when they were tired out, the one in the bow said, "Now, then." And the one in the stern said, "Hold on." Then they again worked hard for a while. Then the bow-man turned towards him. And he again said, "Now, then." And the one in the stern said, "Hold on." His mind was strong, because he was an old man. So he kept saying, "Hold on."
Then he began to sing. And he mentioned the name of Q!adI'ya.2 He also mentioned Tc!alku'ndjus,2 and S8ai'in River.2 And after he was through singing, hesaid, "Now." And Qd'k!a did not understand the things

He could not see anything, and again began crying. While he was still weeping, one said to him, "The chief asks you to come in." At that time he made a hole in his blanket. Then he looked through this hole. Then he saw a sparrow come out from under the grass, and say, "The chief asks you to come in." Then he rose, went thither, and pulled the grasses to one side. But then they opened the door. And after he had entered, he saw another of his aunts inside. "Why does Qa'k!a always do this way?" she said. After he had been there for a while, night came on, and they went to get food. And he again collected water-soaked wood. Then he brought it in and put it into the fire, as formerly. And after it had dried for a while, and they were nearly home, he also put dry wood into the fire. And when they began to come, he lay down. And when they shook themselves, the fire never went out. In the evening they again went to get food. They did not try to get anything in the middle of the day. He saw certain things hanging from the ceiling of the house. And he saw a blue skin hanging near the door. And after they got food, his aunt spoke to him. "Do not touch those things hanging there," she said to him. Afterward he carried up firewood.

And they went out to it. As they went out, the noise decreased. When they could no longer hear the cries, the canoe drifted about aimlessly. But they still heard the cries from the shore. And when the canoe got back, they heard them making a noise again. They were unsuccessful for two nights. Then one of the old men again spoke. "Let us tell them to clean out the inside of the chief's house to drink salt water there," he said. So they began to clean it out. And they drank salt water there for two nights. Then they went out again. Then they went out to the many birds upon the log. At that time they saw Qa'k!a's dead body lying upon it. They saw that there was much bird-manure upon him. And they took him into the canoe. And they brought his dead body to the town. And the old men said, "Do not take him into the house." They said, "Put him on top of the house." So they put him on top of the house, as they had said. And they drank salt water below him for four nights. And when the four nights were over, he came to life on top of the house. Then they took him into the house. He became a shaman. And when they took him into the house, he acted like a shaman. And when they took him into the house, his old wife entered. But his young wife had married some one else. And when he performed as a shaman, the Cormorant, Sea-Gull, and "o-a' (a diver) came in to help him sing. These all settled upon the house. Only his old wife came back to him.

At D&'iAngun,' Ldjanf was a good hunter. And another person also knew well how to tie a canoe when they went ashore. So they always took him with them. So he took this one with him. And they went out, - in all, four men. And they went out to Strong-Tide. And a large reef stood out of the water far out at sea. There they landed. They landed upon this reef, which was named Da'aniAn. And there were many hairseals there. They clubbed those to death. And the four of them were on the rocks. And they were not aware that the anchor-rope had become untied. And there were two spears on the island. There was also a small toolbox' there. Phen the canoe blew away. The wind was north. And it was blown straight out to Gasqo.3 Then they lived upon it. They made a shelter out of hair-seal-skins. Under this they lived. And they clubbed more hair-seals to death. Then they took part of the spear-handles. And they made a fire-drill. When it was finished, they started to make fire. And live-coals dropped from it. Then they lighted a fire. They lived there eight months. All that time the north wind blew. And there was no water to be had. Nor was there any dry food to be had. And they ate nothing but mussels. And they also ate hairseal-meat. And they used the mussel1

And it landed beneath him. And he did not go down to it. He sat high up upon the rocks. And they called him down. And he was afraid of them. And after he had sat up there for a while, he went into the house. And he went to sleep. And this canoe went away from him. They, too, were not his friends. They were Ocean-

his household, because his mind was proud. He made his mind great toward the town-people. So every time they made a feast, they did not call him. Although they made ten feasts, they did not call him. After they had failed to call him for some time, he became sick. After his sickness had lasted for a while, he died. Then those chiefs made other feasts. They did not call his nephews after he was dead. Then (the nephews) questioned an old man. They said to him, "Qo'Iga-it, what do you think about the way they treat us?" Then he said, "Well, chiefs, you two go and cut down a cedar." Then both launched their canoe. And they took two stone And they went thither. axes apiece. Then they cut a cedar down. Then they cut a fathom-length off of it. And they stripped off the bark. Then they put it into the canoe and started off. And they came home with it. When they got home, they carried it And they brouglht it into the up. house. Then they. questioned the old man again. They did not know what he wanted the thing for. They said, "What shall we do with it?" He said, "Carve it into the figure of a man. Put a tall dance-hat upon its head." Then they began to work it. After they had worked it for a while, they finished it. He said, "Make a high place for it in the rear of the house." They did so. "Let me feel of it with my hands," he said. He was blind. And he felt of it. He said, "Have it set in the rear of the house. It is good. It is good."

Have your uncle make a feast, chiefs," he said. Before they made the feast, he said, "They will ask you, 'Who calls us?' Say, 'Chip-Chief calls.'" He called it "Chip-Chief" because it was made of cedar. And they went to call the people. Then (the people) in the first house they entered asked, "Who calls?" they said to them. They answered, "Chip-Chief calls." Every time they entered a house, they said the same thing when they were questioned. Then they called all the people of the town. When they were through calling, all the chiefs came in. After all had seated themselves, one of the servants went up to Chip-Chief, and while standing near him, he said to him, "What shall the chiefs eat?" And although (the chief) did not speak to them, he spoke to himself. Turning towards the fire, (the servant) said, "The chief wants us to give them cranberries." Then they set out ten boxes of cranberries. The house was full of different kinds of fruit. Then they began to set these in front of them. Then they ate them. When they had finished, they stopped. Then one went up to him again. Then he again spoke to him. And when he turned from him to the people, he said, "The chief wants dried berries given to them." Then they set out dried berries. Then they softened them in water. When this was done, they began to set more before them. They

Then they went out. After two days, he called them again. At that time they did not ask who called. Then all the chiefs went in again. Then they again ate food. They ate all sorts of things. There were ten different kinds of food. All that time they made him speak. After he had called them to ten feasts, he was through. Then all the town-people honored him. When they, in turn, invited people to a feast, they went in first to them (the nephews). Then all the chiefs came to love them. They came to love them very much. When their minds were glad because they loved them, they wanted to give them halibut.' Then four of them (the people) launched a big canoe. And there was a small island in front of the town. And no bait was to be found. Then they looked about in the water around the small island. At that time the bow-man saw a devil-fish at the bottom. And he took a stick for it. And he struck at it. And he took it into the canoe with the stick. Then they took stones. They fastenecl the ropes to these. Then (the bow-man) took off the skin of the devil-fish. And he gave some to the others in the canoe. He also kept some for himself. Each of them had three hooks. Then they fastened the devil-fish to the hooks. And each got through with his hooks. Then they fastened hair-seal stomachs to them. Then they placed large sticks right over the places where the hooks When these things were done, were.

they went seaward from the island. And they began to put their hooks into the water. After they had dropped them, they landed on the island. And they watched their floats. They looked at them for a long time. And while they looked at them, the sun was going down. When the sun was very low, something black came towards them from a distance. After it had floated upon the surface of the sea to the side of the canoe, they saw that it was a land-otter. Then the man in the bow took it into the canoe. After he had taken it in, they went out to their hooks. And he took the stomach into the canoe. Then he fastened the land-otter to the stomach. And he threw them both into the water. Just as he threw it, the halibut bit his hook. His stick (float) went down into the sea. Then he went there and pulled up (his line). Three big halibut were upon it. And when he had pulled one of them out of the sea, he clubbed it. When it was dead, he put it into the canoe. After that he pulled another out. He also began to club this one. And when that was dead, he put it into the canoe. Then he pulled out another. And he clubbed it. And when it was dead, he took it into the canoe. Then he unfastened the land-otter. And when he had unfastened it, he said to one of them, "You, too, fasten it to yours." Then he also fastened it to the stomach. And just as he let it into the water, the halibut bit his hook. On his hook were three halibut. He pulled them out of the water, and

clubbed them to death. And when they were dead, he took them into the canoe. They had only one club, and that was in the shape of a land-otter. Therefore the land-otter came floating to them. And when he had unfastened it, he gave it to the third. He said to him, "You, also, tie it to yours." And he tied it to the stomach. And while he was in the act of putting it into the water, his float also went down. Then he pulled up his hooks. These halibut were not strong. They were big, but weak. Then he took all into the canoe. And the three stopped fishing, because the canoe was full. Then he gave the land-otter to the one in the stern. And he also fastened on the stomach. As soon as he had thrown it, his float went down. They were directly in front of the town. And when the tide was low, the small children went down upon the beach to play along with a grown person. And after the man in the stern had pulled his hooks out of the water, he clubbed (the halibut). And he put them into the canoe. And each one killed three halibut. And the canoe was full. Then they stopped fishing. When the canoe was full, the man in the stern said, "Let us go home." And they started home. It was very calm. And when they came near the shore, the children playing there saw them. And when they saw them, they said, "Look at the land-otters swimming this way!"

After they had floated there for a while, the man in the bow said, "Let us go there again." Then they drew the stone into their canoe. And again they went thither. Again the children were playing there. And when they came near the land, they again said, "Look at the land-otters swimming this way!" Then all the people of the town again threw stones at them. And they again returned to the island where they had anchored. And they let down their anchor there. And they floated there. Then they were surprised at themselves. They thought that they had become land-otters. And while they were floating upon the ocean, evening came. At dawn the one in the bow jumped into the sea. He became a land-otter. Then the next one stood up, and he, too, jumped out of the canoe. Then the next one also rose, and jumped into the water. And the one in the stern jumped in last, after them. And each of the four became a land-otter. They became land-otters, because they used the land-otter for a float. When they were lost, (the people) went in search of them. They came to their canoe. They had filled their canoe with halibut. They saw it. When they saw that the canoe was empty (of people), they did not touch it. They were afraid to touch it. And they went away. When they arrived at the town, they were questioned.

44. The Man who was carried off by the Land-Otters. There was a certain man at the town of Gwaiyi'.' His name was Qa'k!a.2 He had many children. When it was calm at sea, he left the town. And far from the town was a point of land. Near this was a harbor. When "he came around the point, he saw some Land-Otters swimming about. Then some of them made a great noise. Then he spoke to his wife. "They are calling for me," he said. At that time he took off his clothing. Then he stood up. She said to her husband, "What is the matter with you?" Then she seized her husband. He said, "Let me jump in. They are calling me." Then, although his wife was unwilling, he jumped in. Then her husband came up in the midst of the Land-Otters. They took him on account of his name Qa'k!a. 'And they crossed to Point Si'k!a 3 with him. They came from Point SI'k!a to get him. Then his wife went back. Her children were with her. She had three.

They said to one another, "What shall we do?" All entered the house of the chief and they talked it over. At that time a certain one went hunting. And when he got to Point Si'k!a, some one was heard calling.l (Qa'k!a) was there a long time (with the Land-Otters). When the (LandOtters) returned from fishing, he came down to the beach to meet them. At that time an old woman was sitting in the corner. She said to him, "When they go to fish, do not get dry stuff for firewood. Get nothing but wet things." Still he got dry stuff for firewood. Then they returned from fishing. The whole town returned into the chief's house. When they got back from fishing, he lighted the fire for them. When they came near, he went down to meet them. He said to them, "Do not come ashore." He said this, although he was not angry. They were very much afraid of him.

He did these things, for they had him work like a slave. This (what they had gotten) was black-cod. Then they put stones in. And when it boiled, they spread it upon something. And (the cod) were cooked. And after they had taken off the covers, there was a little froth in the middle. Then they took out this froth for the chief. It was very precious. Only the chief ate it, because it was very precious. But afterwards the town-people ate. This froth was called "the-eye-of-the-boiling." And (Qa'k!a) also ate what was left with them. Next day they went fishing again. Then the old woman again spoke to him. She said to -him, "Stop getting dry things for firewood." He said to her, "Now I will do as you say." She spoke to him while they were fishing. Because the firewood was dry, it was whisked out quickly. So, when they came in from fishing, he took wet wood. And he put all into the fire. Then he went down to them. " Now, Qa'k!a, let us come ashore, because we are cold." Then he said, "Well, come ashore." Then they struck their tails into the fire again. But this time they were unable to put it out. Then they were very much pleased with him. "Get this kind always," they said. Then they put stones into the fire for the things they had brought in. At that time he questioned the old woman. He whispered to her in her ear, "Have y-ou a spoon?" She said

Then they questioned him.- They said to him, "Why did they take you?" He said, "They took me on account of my name." - "What did you do to thein to cause this doorway to be too small for you?" they said to him. " (They did it) because I took two precious things of theirs," he said. 'Is it a town?" they asked him. " Yes," he said. They said to him, "Shall we kill them all?" - "Now prepare things with which to destroy them," he said. They said to one anotheY, "How shall we destroy them?" They said to one another, "Put fire into all the dens. - Is fire alone sufficient?" they asked of the old man. "Do not take fire only," he said. "Take urine. Take blue hellebore and pitch," he said. And all did according to his words. Then they took urine. And they took these things to the Land-Otters. The whole town went. They carried all thither. They also made clubs. And they came up to the town. Then one man stood at the mouth of each den. And then they poured this urine into them. After that, they made fires with pitchwood at the mouths of the dens. And after the fires had burned for a while, and the fires were all out, the LandOtters got weak and came slowly to the mouths of the dens. And when they came out, they clubbed them to death.

Although they had destroyed the town, he did not come out soon. He acted that way because he was chief. Then they still kept a fire in front of his house. And they remained in front of it all night.

And when they went by it, they laughed at it, because it was made to grow long in the sunshine. And a woman who came after them waded up to it, and sprinkled fresh water uponi it. And when she had cooled it, it became firm, because she made it very strong. Every time they went to get things, she sprinkled it in this way. When it was sunshiny, she always sprinkled it with water. She sprinkled it with water one summer. Then came winter. And the food of the town-people was gone. Then the wind blew continually from the north. There was no way of getting, provisions. The land was frozen very hard. All that time there was no food. When the tide was low, the ground left bare at ebb was frozen. At that time a certain one warmed himself. Then he went to UnfinishedIsland after clams. At that time he saw many things come ashore. Then he carried these up in baskets. Then he carried up one basket on his back. Then he gave them to all in the town. And he shared them equally, in proportion to the number of children they had.

When they were almost starved, the woman who had sprinkled the red-face with water went to it. Then she went out to see the stone. When she got to it, the tail of a spring salmon hung out of the mouth of the red-face. Then she took it away. Then they put stones into the fire for it. When these were hot, they steamed it. When it was done, they gave it to them in small baskets along with the broth. Next day she went there again. But then she saw that there was a whole one there. And she took it away. After she had brought it to the house, they began to cut it up. They cut it into very small pieces. And she gave food to all the people of the town. And after they had cooked it, they chewed it. They also put it into the mouths of their children. And they swallowed the broth. Next day she went thither again. Then a whole one hung from its mouth, as before. As they had given away the former one, they gave away this. And they gave it to all. And after they had cooked it, they chewed it. They were afraid to swallow it at once, because, if they swallowed it at once, they would starve afterwards. Next day she went to see it again. She did not tell them where she got it.

They were carried down in a bunch one over another. Then they hunted among them for their sister. Now all the Frogs had come down from it. At that time they saw her husband swimming down with her. Then her two brothers ran down to take her. She and her child were upon her husband's. back. She sat upon her husband, and her child also sat upon him. Then (the brothers) snatched up their sister and her child. The whole town crowded around them. And they took her home. And they took her into her father's house. Then they questioned her. They said to her, "Who married you? Why did he marry you?" - "Because, when people wanted to marry me, they were refused," she said. "Is the town a good one?" her father asked of her. Then she said the town was good. They said to her, "What did the people of the town eat?" - They ate nothing except choice berries," she said. And they could not make her like themselves. Her skin had become like that of a frog. Her child, too, was way. She did not that eat some things they told her to eat. And she still wanted to go back to her husband, for she liked the place. Then her child disappeared. They always kept watch on it. After that, she also disappeared for good. She went back to her husband. The e-nd.

After they had gone along for a while, they came to a big town. They said to him, "Enter the chief's house in the middle." And they led him in. Then a woman was lying in the rear of it. And they told him to sit at one side. When he sat down, they said to him, "Did you tease this woman?" And he said, "Yes." - "Why did you tease her? You see she is going to die. What were you thinking of when you did it?" they said to him. He said, "I did it to her because I wanted her." And the chief was not to be seen in the house. He had gone to pick cranberries.

He asked him, "To what family do you belong?" -I belong to the K1'ksadi,"' he said. Then (the chief) said, "Yes, yes, let him marry his aunt." 2 And they let him marry her. They took the woman by the hand and made her stand up. And he was there a long time. They ate dried berries, and they ate soapberries, cranberries, and crab-apples. After he had lived there for a while, he said to his wife, 'I want to go back." Then the chief said to him, "All right, go back. Go in the canoe in which I brought things." Next day the people of the town collected all kinds of food. And they launched their canoe. The canoe was a big one. And then they began to put all kinds of food into the canoe. And the canoe was completely filled.The canoe-men were very numerous. Then they started off. They came to T!a'qo. And the things in the canoe were taken up to the house.

Then she tried to pull the devil-fish arm off from her arm. And she could not take it off. Then she called for help to the children playing up the beach. Then they came down to her, and tried to turn the stone over. And they could not do it. Then they went into the house to tell about her. Then her father and her mother went down. And when they were unsuccessful, they called out. And others went down. And when those could not accomplish it, they went to tell the people of the town. And when these went down to it, they took long stout sticks. They tried to turn (the stone) over. Although it was small, they were unsuccessful. When the tide came up to her, they hurried.

The next morning, when (the stone) was dry, they went down to it, and the one who first reached it turned it over. They thought that her dead body was there. And she was not there. Then her parents burned off their hair. Some time afterward a shaman said, "The child of the chief's daughter who was lost is going to come." He said, "Watch for it." So, after they had watched for a while, a small Devil-Fish came up out of the sea. And they had kept a copper for the lost child. They had also kept an elk-skin.

On account of that, his father-in-law could not sleep. The morning after, they were real human beings. And at night they became Devil-Fish. Afterwards his father-in-law made a feast. And after the feast was made, he lived with his father-in-law for some time. Then the woman spoke to her father. She said to her father, "Father, I shall not see you again." (The people) did not see him go away from his father-in-law. He went into the water in the night. So in the evening he went away from his father-in-law. And his wife ceased to see her father.

48. The Two Shamans.'

A shaman at the town of Sq!aos 2 had a friend. They lived together. They were very fond of each other. And he said to his friend, "Let us go away." - "Where?" (the other) said to him. He said to him, "To LUa'ot!A point." And they went out. And the other went in front. Then he saw a swimming land-otter. And he speared it. And he killed it. Then he arrived at the place whither they were bound. But then his friend came after him. Then he saw that he had killed the land-otter. He said

He stretched it upon a cedar plank. His friend was very glad on account of it. And it was dry. Then he pulled it off from the plank. He did this in the house in the evening. Then he wanted to get its fur on the outside. He wanted to turn it inside out. His friend saw that he could not. He said to him, "What will you do with it?" He said, "Use it as a case for beating-sticks." "Friend, give it to me." He said this to him, because he (the owner) was unable to accomplish (what he was trying to do). And he gave it to him.

He had said, "Build (the grave) high on the point." They did as his friend had directed them. All that time his friend wept. Then they took him out when it was finished.

He said, "Why did he ask for my land-otter?" When he was through weeping, he went away. And his wife cooked for him. Next day he went to him again. Then he again wept there. All that time he blamed him. He said, "Why did he ask the landotter of me?" After he had said this, he sat there. And while he sat there, evening came on. Then four men in a canoe came rapidly to the place where he lived. The one in the middle wore a big shaman's hat. He was a great shaman. He* said, "Land in front of the shaman who has been raised up." (The man sitting there) heard what he said. (The shaman) said to the bow-man, "Go up to him." So he went up to him. They did not see the friend sitting beneath. Then the one who had gone up moved the dead man's head. The friend observed this. And (the man) pulled off the skin from (the body). Then he went down with it. And the friend followed his friend's skin. When they put the skin into the canoe, the great shaman hunted about among the dead for shamans' skins. FHe put many into the canoe. (The friend) seated himself behind this big shaman. They did not see him get aboard. He braced his knees against (the shaman). Then right where the knees were, he felt great pain. After he had suffered a while, (the friend) moved away from him again. (The shaman)

said, "Take me quickly." And they got there with him. They had taken aboard many shamans' skins. Then the great shaman entered his house. And when they carried up his friend's skin, he went up with it. A round thing (a pole to hang skins on) ran all around the inside of the house. It was full of these things. This is the way (the shaman) had always done. (The man) heard (the people) say of his friend's skin, "Hang this one up there." So they hung it near by. Then he sat down again. At that time he seized (the big shaman) again around the waist, and put his knees strongly against his back. Then (the shaman) suffered a great deal. Then they went to get a shaman. Then they went around him repeatedly. And after he had suffered a while, (the friend) moved off a little. He sat behind him all the time. The shaman was unable to save (the sick one). Then they went for another. They also got this one to him. This one, also, circuited around him. And he could not cure him. They brought ten shamans for him. All that time (the friend) pressed against (the sick man). After they had had the ten shamans, their hearts were tired. They went for Supernatural-Being-greatly-Honoredtravelling-by-Canoe. Then they arrived with him. While still at a distance he saw that behind the (sick) shaman sat a shaman who gave him a severe sickness because his friend's skin had been put into the canoe. When the shaman arrived, he entered the house. Then he saw (the man) sitting behind (the sick one). As he entered, he

he went over again. He went over without letting any one see him. He was afraid to have them see him. And the son of the town-chief went over there very early. Then he saw some one sitting near where the stone lay. Then he observed him stealthily. After he had looked at him for a while, he saw him dreos himself up. And when he stood up, he acted like a shaman. (The chief's son) saw that. Then he saw this Devil-Fish come up in front of (the person). The Devil-Fish spoke to him. The stone was above high water. And, after it had spoken to him, it said to him, "Go home." And while he was taking his (shaman's) clothing off, (the chief's son) ran to him. Then he seized him. He (the shaman) said to him, "Do not tell about me." (And) he said to him, "I made this weather bad. To-morrow it will be calm." So it was calm. At that time there were all sorts of salmon in the river. And a red-cod was among them. And they went into a deep place far down in the water. It (the red-cod) was always to be seen. And (the people) took the fish out. They ate them. They always took them out from this place. At that time a small girl had just reached maturity. And the red-cod could not hide itself, because it was red. And they threw it away. And the menstruant girl crossed the river.' Therefore she made those fish disappear. And the man who was possessed by a mouse became a stone. He sat in front of the town. TIhere

So it is now called "Fishing-Lines-around-the-Neck." When a storm lasts for a long time, they put fishing-lines around his neck. They also paint his face. When they paint his face red, the wind becomes fair. "The last generation of people will do this," he said. So they do it still.

5o. The Woman who became Ten women went from the town of L2uln' to get bark. And they arrived on the other side (of Naden). The stream in the valley of which they were is named DasL. And when they were about to go up to the woods, they anchored their canoe at an island lying in the mouth, because they thought they would come down when the tide was low. This island is named T!ed. The canoe was upon this. And then they went up into the woods together. And after they had gone on for a while, they came to many young cedars. They said to one another, "Let no one wander far away." Then a certain young woman was with them. In spite of the directions they had given one another, she went far away from them. And when they pulled off cedar-bark, she did the same thing. She tried to pull it off, and although there were no branches to be seen,2 she was unable to pull it down. While she was trying to do this, the sun set.

Then she was very unhappy. When she also tried to pull down small cedars, she was unable to do so. She went far away from them. At that time she came to a young tree. Then she saw that there was much pink gum upon it. Then she began to take it off and put it into her mouth, from the bottom up. When her ball had become large and round, she put it aside. When she had a great deal, she heard (the people) calling to her. She did not reply. When she did not reply, those who called her were very much troubled. Then all sat down in one place in the trail.' Then they said, "Call to her." But when they called to her, a woodpecker answered. And when they called to her aogain, it answered again. They said to one another, "Let us go straight towards the thing that is calling." Then all started. And after they had gone for a while, they called again. Then it sounded close by them. They said to one another, "Let us go to the place where it calls near by." And they came to where the gum-tree stood. And they saw her lifeless body lying beneath it. Then they made her sit upright. After they had made her sit up, something made a noise in her chest. She had become a shaman. She made herself a shaman while chewing gum there. They did not know at first that she was a shaman. But when she talked as shamans do, they knew it. And there was no way to get her

When he sat in front of them as he went around the fire, he said to them, "Make your minds sober." Some one had pointed his fingers 3 at a big black cloud. So the shaman spoke in this way. He said to them, "A dreadful thing is about to befall you." Then two big waves came towards the land from this black cloud. At the same time the wind blew hard. While it was blowing hard, ten days passed. All that time snow fell. The food was gone. Since they thought it would come to an end, they counted the nights. And ten more days passed. The beach in front of the town was covered with foam. Then a little girl took gum from the trees with her teeth. She spit out the juice into a little tray. And she put snow into it, mixed it up, and ate it. And this tasted very good to her. "Just do this way," she said. So all went to get it. And the many people gave to one another.

the shaman went to the lake one calm morning, while it was still dark. He went to the lake. When he came to the lake, he dressed himself beside it again. He put on his shaman's apparel. And the power came through him again. He began to act like a shaman. Then the devil-fish again came up below him. And when he had taken off his apparel, he carried up the devil-fish. When he entered, he said to him (the younger), "Get up. It is a very calm day. Let us go fishing again.' And when he rose, they carried their fishing-tackle down to the beach again. Then they put their canoe into the water and went out. Again they staid in Qok!alo't. He gave half of the devil-fish to his younger brother. Then they let down their hooks. They used the ends of branches for hooks. And again the fishes bit only the hooks of the elder. Again it was only the elder brother who filled the canoe. Although his younger brother fished with a part of the devil-fish, he did not catch a halibut. Then he was very sorry. And (the brothers) went home. And after they had reached home, both of them carried up the halibut. (The younger) helped his elder brother. Their two wives cut out the entrails. (The younger) helped each other because (the elder) gave part to him. He did this way four times. Then the younger brother thought that there was something wrong. And after many nights had passed, when it was early morning, they were going out fishing. Before they went, he watched his elder brother stealthily. He watched stealthily what he did.

Then he saw the devil-fish come up under him. And he went back into the house. Next day very early he went to the shamnan's dress. And when he came there, he opened his (elder brother's) box. And he took his shaman's dress out of it. Then he went quickly to the lake. And he put it on. And he acted in the way his elder brother had done. And the devil-fish came up below him. Then he took it off quickly and went to the box. And while his elder brother was coming, he put the shaman's dress into it. And he went to the house. And he put the devil-fish just outside. And when he entered, he went to bed, because it was still dark. Then he watched his elder brother secretly. Then his elder brother rose, took his shaman's dress, and went to the lake. And he used it as he had done before. But yet no devil-fish swam up below him. After he had tried the same thing twice, he gave it up. Then he took off his shaman's dress and went home. And when he entered (the house), he said to his younger brother, " Get up. Let us go fishing. It is going to be very calm. A little of the devil-fish is still in the canoe" And when they went fishing, he hid the devil-fish from his elder brother. The younger one's name was Wi'lala-Man. They again stopped at Qok!alo't to fish. And nothing bit either hook quickly. And after they had remained there for a while, something bit the younger one's hook. He was unable to pull the halibut up. When he pulled a little, the halibut began to run. And after (the

"Gw!'dAlqa,' yes," he said. And it ran westward with them. Then it swam under the rocks with them, and the kelp-line ran through the rocks. And it swam around this island with them. It carried them around Cape St. James.2 And it pulled them around the entire island. Then the shaman questioned his younger brother again. He said to hirn, "Wi'lala-Man, is the kelp-line strong?"Gwi'dAlqa, yes." And it dragged them back to the place where they had been fishing. Then it stopped there with them. But then it let itself be pulled up. And when (the younger brother) had pulled it up, the water was full of big halibut and small halibut. Then he said to his younger brother, "Pull it up right under the canoe, so that we can spear the halibut with sticks." So he spoke to him. And so he did. Then Wi'lala-Man tied the kelp-line to the canoe. And both of them began to spear halibut. Then they quickly filled the canoe. And when (Wi'lala-Man) was ready to go, he untied his kelp-line. And he did not see anything on the hooks. The halibut was called Never-Appearing. It was also called Going-aroundthe-Island. Then they came ashore. And when they entered, their wives' hair was burnt.

They said, "A big halibut bit one of our hooks, and swam around the entire island with us.' They were very sorry for their wives. Because they were very sorry for their wives, they did not let them go down for the halibut. They went down themselves. They began to dry the halibut that their wives cut up. After they were through drying their halibut, they went to the town. And they recounted the story to their friends. "Some supernatural creature dragged us around the island. So we stopped fishing. A big halibut did it," they said. They said, "We stopped fishing because it frightened us." This was done to them, because (the one) put on his elder brother's shaman's dress secretly. And the elder brother did not know what his younger brother had done.

The Shaman at Dorsal-Fin-Town.'

Sea-Lion lived at Dorsal-Fin-Town.2 He belonged to the Rear-Town-People.3 He was also a shaman. Only OceanPeople spoke through him. In DorsalFin-Town they were starving. Then the people of the town were almost starved. The south wind blew for ten days. All that time snow was falling. And near the town was a hair-seal cave. When this was full of hair-seal, (the people) used to take them out.

And these ceased to be there. Therefore they were starving. At the end of ten days the shaman was going to drink sea-water. Then they called the people of the town. With all the chiefs the house was full. When it was full, they brought in four stones. rhey put them into the fire, and the stones were heated. (The shaman) said, "Bring me sea-water." And they brought sea-water in his big seawater box. Then they brought out the tongs for the stones. And they put them into the box with them. Then they put something over it. When it was warm enough, he asked for a cup. And they brought it to him. It was in the shape of a killer-whale. Then they fastened on his dancingblanket. And they put his bone necklace around his neck. They also put one (bone) through his nose. Then they fastened his hair. And they put bones through it. Then they put eagle's down on his hair. And he also asked for red paint. And they brought it to him. After they had brought it to him, he turned (the bag) inside out. And he painted his chest with it. Then he put it upon his lips. After that,. he called to him a certain man who sat there. And he came to him. Then he gave him the paint. He said to him, "Paint all (the people) with it." After he was through doing this, he placed it near (the shaman). Then he took his rattle out of the box. At that time something spoke through him. After sticks had been given out to the people, they began to sing. All the sticks were carved. They were in the shapes of Ocean-

And after he had performed thus for a while, he acted as if he were snatching out something. Then he went around the fire twice with it. But when he stood there, he looked into the salt water. He said, "My servants, they are going to give you food." He said so, because he saw the soul of a whale in the water. Then he sat down. After the supernatural being had gone out of him, he dipped a cup in. When it was filled, he gave it to the one who sat next to him. Then he drank all of it. And when they returned the empty cup, he took it again. And he gave it out. He started to distribute it from the right to the left, and gave it to all the people. But he had not drunk himself. Then he took sea-water in the cup to drink. Then he drank. And he dipped some out again. He drank. Then he put it back in the place where it had been before. All the chiefs talked about this. After they had sat there for a while, they were all taken with diarrhoea. And they defecated. And after they had re-entered and had sat there for a while, they put sea-water into the box again.

He soon used the water up, because there was a crowd. As soon as it was used up, they went to get some again. They also brought that up to the house. He also gave that to them. They drank ten boxes of that. And it was finished. After they had drunk the water, no food was to be seen. They only chewed native tobacco. Then he directed them as follows. He said, " To-morrow morning, when I go out, look at me. Do not let the women look at ine." The day after, he went out early. He directed them: "In the morning, let all come in front of my house." So they did. And they brought the shaman's box to him. Then he took the cover off of it. And they put a dancing-apron around him. He said, "To-morrow the sea will be calm." It was calm, as he had said. Then they put a dancing-hat upon his head. When hie was ready, he said, "Now look at me." He said, "Do not enter the houses. As long as I am away, watch the place whither I go." It was low tide. Then he went seaward.

When he came to Tc!ao-qa'Las,l he went down under the waves. They looked at him for a while when he vanished underneath. They watched for him. As he had said, after a while there came a sound like the noise of a cannon. Then the tide was rising. While they watched, a whale's tajl came out. And he came out by the side of it, as it lay ,half in the sea. Then he came away But when he came up, upon the sea. he threw something upon them. "All of you take it," he said to them. He said to them, "Sit in a straight line" (i. e., one behind another). So they sat in a straight line. After he had thrown something upon them, they all seized it. He said to them, "Do as I do." And they drew it towards themselves. While they were doing as Sea-Lion did, the whale went down.2 And then it floated upon the sea. Then he danced still more. After they had pulled thus for a while, the whale came ashore in front of the town, at the ebb of the tide. They did not see the thing he threw to them. They did not see the rope that the shaman had fastened to it. They pulled it with empty hands. Only the shaman saw it. They did not know what he did. And it (the whale) was left by the tide in front of the town. After it was left dry, they went down

A Story of the StA'stas.

They went from House-Point to hunt hair-seal. And they landed at Reef-Point.2 And they ran to get hairseal with clubs. They did not pull the canoe higher. And no one looked after it. Then they clubbed very many hair-seals. And there was a white one3 among them. Then, while they carried the hair-seal up, a big wave came rolling in. And the hair-seals were all carried into the sea. The canoe also floated away. And not one of the people was killed. And since they could do nothing, they remained there. Then the canoe was blown far out from them. It was blown frorn the land. And when the canoe was almost out of sight, a shaman commenced his song. Then the canoe pointed towards them. And it started towards them. And it landed below them while he sang. Then they got into the canoe and came away.

The Two Tlingit Shamans.'

rhe town-chief of Xui'dji-no 2 was a shaman, and there was a town-chief at Hd'nAfia also. Thody were very fond of each other. He was also a shaman. Because they were both shamans, they were friends to each other. Then the one went up to the chief at Xu'dji-no. After two days he started home. And all kinds of food were given to him, along with soap-berries and cranberries. He reached his town. Then he called the people for the feast. And he had told (his friend) that he would go up again. So he went up. And he only remained with him there for two nights. He said to him, "I will come up to you yet again." And he again went up. At that time he brought all of his shaman's outfit in a box. It was a big box. HIe had a big ribbon in his box. At one end was the skin of a bufflehead, stripped off in one piece. He used to fish for his supernatural power with it. It (the power) was named Da'oxaiya. And when he reached his friend, (the people) were going to give him food. And he refused. He said to him, "On the contrary, I will give food to the people of your town." Then there were big cedar planks in the rear of the house. And he asked for his shaman's box. Then they brought his shaman's box to him. And a certain one always took off the He allowed him to open it cover. every time, because, after his own death, (this man) wanted to be a shaman (in

These bones were all carved to represent his supernatural powers. And they also gave him his club. Then they (the spirits) came powerfully through him. They also put a bent bone through his nose. After that, they sang for him and beat time for him as he went around the fire. Then the box was placed for him on the big planks in the rear of the house. He sat upon it.. Then he told them to pry the planks apart. And they did so. So there was an opening between. But then he asked for his ribbon. And they gave it to him. And he went around the fire with it. Then he sat upon the box again. And he began to fish between these (planks). All the townpeople were in the house. He began to fish for his supernatural power. And after he had let it go down for a while, he had a bite. And after (the creature) had run out for a while with his bait, and only a little of the ribbon was left, he became troubled. Then he said to it, "Make yourself lighter, Da'oxaiya." One of his powers was called Da'oxaiya. It tried to swim under the island with (his line). Then he acted as if it were light. Then he drew the head (of the creature) up between the planks. At that time they put the club into his hands. It was very heavy. Then he struck it when he got it upon the planks. After he had struck it twice, it died. Then he told them to put stones

And at that time, they put water into the steamingbox. Then they put meat and fat in together. Then it boiled a long time. Then they put it upon mats. The town-people did not touch it. His own people took care of it. While it was boiling, they called those who were seated in the houses for (the food). When not even a little child was left in the houses, they removed the covers. They took (the food) out into a big tray. Then the shaman spoke. He said to (the people), "If you eat this, you will not be sick. Nor will you die." Then (his friends) began to give this to them, meat and fat together. "When this broth becomes cool, let your children drink it to make them grow big.

And he went up to the woods upon it. And he came to a mountain. And below it lay a big lake. Then he wept continually upon the shore. I-He did not walk about, and he shut his eyes where he had sat down. And while he had his eyes shut, he was touched upon the shoulder. One said to him, "The chief asks you in." Then he looked -to see the thing that said this. And a small green person stood there. 'Come in quickly," (the person) said to him. (The person) said, "Put your feet upon the surface of the sea. The chief's door opens here. Now stand up," he said to him, seizing him by the shoulder at the same time. After he had pulled him up, he placed him upon the surface of the sea. He took him into it with him. Then he came with him in front of a big house. He said to him, "Remain standing here." And he went in from him. He went to tell the chief. He (the chief) said to him, "Where is the person I sent you to call?" He said to him, "He is right outside." And when he entered, the chief said, "Have him sit here." So they seated him near (the chief), who said to him, "Your trouble is hard." Then (the chief) toldI them to bring him a big box which was just behind. So they brought it to him. And when he had opened it, he took a box out. He took another box out of that. There were many empty boxes. And

the very last one was small. In it was something very precious. And the nest of some creature was in this box. It was a small bird. Its beak was long. The shaman sat near him. And the chief cared for this bird himself. And he made it sit upon his hand. He said to (his guest), "Take care of this. I will teach you how to use it." He said to (the bird), "Now." Then he made it cry. When it cried, skunk-cabbage-tops grew up in the house. And it cried again. Then salmon-berry-bushes also grew up. All kinds of berry-bushes grew up. Then it cried again. That time all the berries grew upon them.
After he had taught hinm about it, however, he gave it to him. " Now go out," he said to him. But when he was about to go out, he gave him directions. "When you get out, go down to your friend during the night." Arrive near the town during the night. Do not get there while it is light," he said to him. "In the night go back of the town. When you are through, do not bring it (the bird) here. But put it into a lake, and it will be in my house," he said to him. "Now go. Do as I have directed you. Do not sleep," he said to himn. And (the shaman) he came away from him. And after he had come away, he went down. And he reached the end of the town during the night. The same night he went back of the towni with (his gift). At that time he had it under his blanket. He took it out. Then he made it call. Then the berries all ripened. When these berries were ripe,

"Will you not eat?" they said to him. He belonged to the same clan as the Grisly-Bears. Then they gave him salmon to eat. This was the first time he had eaten after they destroyed his town. They said to him, "When will you go?" He said, " I shall go to-morrow." They said to him, "Shall we not give you food?" - " No," he said. And he left that place also, and came to the head of GIL!a'p (a stream near China Hat). Again he laid his cane across. And he went over upon it. After he had gone on from there for a while, he came to the head of WIk!i'na (Rivers Inlet). It was not far from the sea. And he sat down by its side. Then he sat opposite a big dead tree without a top, lying in the ocean. Then he saw a little salmon jumping about. This was the olachen. And he built a house far back in the woods. Then he heard people from below talking. Then he saw many canoes come. He hid himself. They came up for olachen. And he secretly observed that they were unable to get many of these. And he hunted about in the woods. Then he came to a big fallen cedar broken in pieces. And he began to pull this to pieces. He broke it into very fine pieces. He made very many. And he finished them. Then he brought them near the house he had built. But then he went to get long cedar-boughs. Then he went to get roots of trees for it. And he made a net. He plaited it for two days.

In the evening he went down to the fallen tree. And after he had put it into the water far below, he felt that it was full. And, being unable to lift it, he drew it ashore upon the log. And after he had drawn it ashore, he poured (the olachen) out upon the sand. And when morning came, and they again came up for olachen, there were very many canoes. Then they saw these many olachen. At that time he looked at them from his hiding-place. When the canoes had come to land, they contested with one another to see who would get there first. They crowded upon one another. They took two, or three, or four, because they [their bodies] were many. And then they went down. Next night he poured them out twice. When morning came, they again came up. At that time, however, there were very many olachen. Then they did not know who did this. And they guessed that some supernatural being did it. They said, "Some supernatural being living in the river does it." Next night he poured out four times. WThen they were surprised at this, they dressed up a woman. And they took up this woman who had been so adorned. Her father's name was Qoe'Las. Then they left her there, and all went home. After they had gone down, he came to her.

And when a certain strong man reached far under the stones, he put his hand into the open mouth of a Lq!o'ytii-q!atc!a'.' And it shut its mouth upon the man's hand. And they were unable to pull his hand 'out. And while the bivalve had its mouth shut upon his hand, the tide came in. And when it got near, he sang before he died, "From whence comes the tide that is going to take me?" And his friends heard him sing. Then they knew it was he. Hie sang many songs. At that time they did not have steel knives. And the water came over him. And they heard the singing cease. When the water finally came over him, he was drowned.
Next day, when the tide was out, his friends went down to get him. And having sharpened the branches of trees, they took them. And when they came to him, they pushed the sticks into the mouth of the bivalve. And after they had done this, they took it (the hand) out. And, being angry with it (the bivalve), they broke it while his hand was still inside. And after they had withdrawn his hand, they took his body up to the house. And a certain shaman's friends wanted to see him. The shaman lived away from the town. His friends lived at the town. This shaman's name was Tc!ixi'.'

He also put the cedar-bark and the housetimbers into the canoe. And when the canoe floated, he and his wife and his three children got in. They did not go up to see his friends. They did not let one of their children go up, for they were angry because (his friends) did not come down to see them. And as the tide came in, they floated up. And when the tide was high, they came floating up to the town. And when they saw that the tide had stopped, they got off.

Eight days afterward some supernatural being spoke through him. He tied his dance-apron around himself. The people also put a bone necklace around his neck. They also put (a bone) through his nose. They also pushed bones through his hair. And as they sang, they beat time for him to go around the fire. Then his supernatural helpers were very much surprised. "Ha ha ya ha ha ya," he said. And when they left him, he said, "A canoe is coming around that point to make peace." At this the spirits were surprised. "Did not one of your uncles kill some one not long ago?" he asked of them. He said this, although there had been no fight before that in the town. And they denied it. They said, "We do not know anything about it." He said, "To-morrow a big canoe is going to come around that point." After they had kept on the lookout for it, they heard a drum sounding behind the point. After the drum had beaten a slow measure for a while, a big canoe came around. And one stood in the middle. Feathers were pushed through his hair. There was also (bird) down upon his hair. At that time they were singing for him. Then he danced. He also made a noise by shaking something he held in both hands. And they came in front of the town.

The little old man sat near the fire. When all were snoring, the little old man said, "A-a-a, this is a proud town." And they ceased to make the noise. And when morning came, the people assembled in front of the house. And they awaited them in two rows from the house to the sea. And the canoe was a rotten tree lying broken there. And only the broken bits were there. And in the morning one went out. And when he got near the sea, they clubbed him. And he died. And a land-otter went rolling down. Then all came out. And they clubbed them to death as they came out. And the "deer" (peace-dancer)1 did not come out soon. He came out a long time after them. When he came out, all clubbed him. But still he was alive. When he got far down, they struck off his head. Then he died. When all were dead, they launched a canoe for them. And the legs of all the land-otters were white. Then they began to put them into their canoe. And they carried them to an island. There were no trees on the island. And they threw the land-otters down there. Only bushes grew upon it.

was also fond of fighting. His name was Qa'k!usiia-i. After he had gambled for a while, they wounded him in a fight. His younger brother had gone after someting in his canoe. And he did not do anything in revenge. He waited for his younger brother. Then his younger brother arrived. And after he had landed, he entered. They were very much afraid of him. And they told the younger brother that his elder brother had been wounded. When they told him, he said to his elder brother, "Do nothing in revenge." He obeyed. Their uncle owned a mountain of ground-hogs. He was about to go to it. And so (the younger) said this to his elder brother, who had never gone to the ground-hog mountain with his uncle. He said to him, "Go with your uncle, who is about to visit the groundhog mountain." Therefore (the elder) went with his uncle. His uncle and his (uncle's) wife went. These three were all. They came in front of the ground-hog mountain. IHis (uncle's) house always stood there. He always lived there, for they used the groundhog-skins for blankets. And one fine day he went up his ground-hog mountain. Qd'k!usin-a-i went with his uncle. And they arrived. They did not hear (the animals) making noises. And he questioned his nephew. He said, "Do you hear anything?" And Qa'k!usinia-i said, "No, I hear nothing Now let us go up," he said there." to his nephew. Then they walked slowly up the trail. And where there had been many, nothing was to be seen. The holes were all empty.

And they sat there. And it was very dark inside of the cave. Then (the uncle) said to his nephew, "Now run to the house." He told him to go to his wife. "Why shall I do it?" he said to him. He said to him, "Lie with my wife in the house." And (the nephew) came there. And he did as his uncle had told him. And he went up to his uncle again. Then he came to his uncle, who still sat in front of the cave. "Go in before me," he said to his nephew. And he entered in front of him. He (the uncle) entered after him. It was very dark inside. They kept going on. Far off before them, there was light. There was a hole through the mountain, and when they saw the light appear, they heard the ground-hogs making noises. His uncle, although he came far behind, also heard them. Then they came out of the cave. The place was frill of ground-hogs. When (the nephew) approached, a man ran upon him from one side. One also ran at him from the other side. Just as they seized him, he fainted. Land-otters made him do this. They were Ku'staqa and YakU'stAfia-i. And while he was shaking, his uncle heard his voice.

A big devil-fish lived between Mountain Island 1 and the mainland. On their return, when the town came in sight, his nephew said to him, "Let us let you down where this devil-fish lives. You will be ashamed (if you "Wait a little," find no land-otter)." he said. Then he stood in his canoe over the devil-fish. While they were talking, they saw a long black canoe launched at the town. They were very near the town. Therefore his nephews were much ashamed.2 Then his nephews said to him, "A canoe with two men in it is coming toward us from the town.""That is it, that is it," he said.

Then he said, "A cohoes spoke through that shaman, but he will now speak through me." And after its head was cut off, he raised something up high for it, and put it on top. Right there he fainted, because the cohoes was going to speak through him. When he fainted, they put him into the canoe. And they took him to the town. And they took him into his uncle's house. He was still in a faint. Something was over him (a blanket or mat). After he had been in that condition for a while, they said, "A salmon is jumping about in front of the town." Now it beoan to speak through him. This was the cohoes of the one who lived up the river. And the spirits of the one who lived higher up left him. At that time they say that war-canoes used to pass up in front of the town. For they saw the people going to get things. Then he made an image of the salmon and put it above himself. They were troubled on account of the war-canoes which passed up. They were also very much afraid. In the night, while they were awake, the salmon shook. Then the news was told to the people of the town. The salmon did not speak through him. It only shook when the warriors got near. Therefore they did not go out for anything. The cohoes informed the town, just as if some one had spoken to them, so it was not overthrown. And when they went out to pick

Although he was just married, he did the same thing the next morning. He ate in bed. His wife went to get halibut, and he ate. After he had done this for a while, his mother-in-law spoke of him.

When a wizard was dispossessed, the last mouse to leave him was a white one. This is a poor representative specimen, unnecessarily elaborated, of a variety of story popular among the Haida, and of which the story told on pp. 282-285 in the Skidegate Series, Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, is another example. A much better version, obtained in English from Charlie Edensaw by Professor Boas, is appended. For a carving illustrating this story, and for further details regarding it, see Contributions to the Ethnology of the Haida (Publications of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, Vol. VI p. 126). 3 See footnote, p. 567.

After he had gone up for a while, he came to a lake lying inland. And he hunted around the edges. And he found a cedar. It leaned over the lake. And he began to chop at it. After he had chopped it for a while, he brought it down. Then he made wedges for it. And after he had finished them, he went out to it again. And he walked out upon it, and drove the wedges into the middle of it. And he split it along the middle. And after he had opened it for a little distance, he hammered long cross-pieces in. And when he had finished it, he went away. And he began to pull off cedar-boughs for it. And when he was through pulling them off, he went out to the cedar again. Then he built a fire for the cedarboughs. And he twisted them. After he had finished, he began to tie them together. And since there were not enough, he went to get more for (his rope). When he came back from getting them, he twisted them again. And he also tied these to (the rope). When it was long, he started off with it. And when he got behind the town, night came upon him. And while the small children were playing outside, he took a small child away. And he killed it in the woods. And he carried it up towards the lake. And next morning he sank this child's dead body down between the parts of the cedar. And he held the (other) end of the twisted cedar-bough (rope) as he

And when morning came, his motherin-law went out very early. Then she found a whole spring salmon. But they only cut this one open to dry. And again evening came. When they went to bed, and while they were asleep, he went thither. Then he pulled (the skin) down and took it to the sea. And he put it on. Then he dived into the sea with it. After he had swum along for a while, he caught many things. Then he returned with them. And again he threw them up in front of his father-in-law's house.

And after he had pulled it down, he went out to the beach with it, and again he put it on. And going into the water with it, he began to swim along with it. And as he swam along, he took more. And when he returned, he laid them in front of his father-in-law's house. And after he had put (the skin) back, he came in and lay down with his wife.

They dried them. And in the evening she acted as a shaman. She prophesied, "Tomorrow half of a hair-seal will lie upon the beach." While they were asleep, her son-inlaw went to the grisly-bear-skin.

During all that time they gave to the people of the town, who cut them up. And in the evening she again acted as a shaman. And after she had performed, she prophesied. She said, "Tomorrow nine whales will lie upon the beach." And after they went to bed, her son-in-law again went to the grislybear-skin. And after he had pulled it down, he took it down near the shore. Then he put it on, and began to swim with it. And he caught nine whales. And he returned with them. And he threw them up in front of his fatherin-law's house. Then he put the grislybear-skin back between the two treetrunks. Then he again entered the house. And next day, when his motherin-law went out, she found nine whales. And they again gave to the people of the town.

when the sun rose higher, he appeared. They saw him swimming along. Then this woman prepared herself. She put her shamani's dress on. Then they beat time for her again. And while the grisly bear was coming in, she was going down to it. And she got outside. The grisly bear kept coming in. The woman kept going down. And the grisly bear came up into the canoe landing-place. Then the tide came up to the woman's feet. When she went still farther out, the tide came up to her knees. Then the grisly bear came alongside of her. He had eleven whales upon his back, and four in his mouth. One of the number lay between his ears. And when the grisly bear came in, she danced alongside of it. While she was still dancing, her son-in-law canme out from the grisly bear's mouth. Then he did not so much as glance at his mother-in-law. And he went up into the house. After he entered the house, his mother-in-law fell down in the water. Her feelings were broken. Before that, she had made her son-in-law ashamed. And now her son-in-law made her ashamed in turn. And his mother-inlaw died of shame.

There was a town named Guaiskun.' In a small river behind the town lived the Wasx.° There was a young man who intended to marry a girl. He was working for her, as was customary among the Haida. One evening he returned home late. There was no fire in the house, and it was dark.

He took some salmon and tore it, intending to eat it. Then the girl's mother, hearing the noise, said, "Now he is splitting wood for me." This annoyed the young man, and he thought, " I will go and kill the Wasx. Maybe she will thep think more highly of me." He took his stone axe and felled a cedar. He split it in the middle and spread it out. Many children were playing on the street of the town. He induced one of them to accompany him. Then he made a long rope of cedar-twigs, which he coiled up. He painted the body of the child red, placed it in the crack of the tree, and hid near by, watching for the Wasx. Soon the monster came, and tried to devour the boy. Then the man jumped up, knocked out the sticks which held the tree apart, and it closed. Then he threw the cedar-withe line, the end of which he had tied into a noose, over the monster's head, and killed it. Then he opened the tree, took out the monster's body, and skinned it. He made a fire near the water and dried the skin. Then he put it on. Now he himself had assumed the shape of the Wasx, and he went into the water. He walked along the bottom of the river down to the sea. There he saw many whales. He caught them, and carried them ashore to the town. Then he thought, "I wish my wife's mother would become a shaman!" Then she performed the shaman's dance, carrying a wand set with puffin-beaks in her hand. The people sang for her, and she danced in the house. Suddenly she said, "There is a whale outside!" The people went out and found it. Thus four whales drifted ashore, one at a time. The woman always said that they were given by her guardian spirit. After this two whales drifted ashore at the same time, and on the following day another pair of whales drifted ashore. The woman became a great chieftainess. One day she danced again, and said, "My guardian spirit informs me that he will send a whale right to the middle of our town. You will see it outside. I told him to bring it here. Let us dance and sing on the street to-morrow morning, and you will see it coming ashore." On the following morning the people assembled on the street. They began to sing, and she danced in their midst. Now they saw a Wasx rising in the distance. He carried two whales on his head, one on his tail, and one under each arm. Now he came ashore. The woman continued to dance. Suddenly the Wasx threw off' his skin, and they discovered the young man who said to the dancing woman, "Do you remember scolding me once saying that I was splitting cedar-wood while I was eating 'salmon? Now you see my power. I sent these whales, and I am bringing you whales to-day. Your guardian spirit did not send them." Then the woman was ashamed. She fell down and died.

6i. The Half-Head that married a Certain Person.

They were living at a certain town. And there was a chief's daughter there. And people in all places wanted to marry her. All that time her parents refused. They wanted a wise man to marry their daughter. After people had been unsuccessful in trying to get her for a long time, a Half-Head came in to her during the night. Then her father heard something speaking to her the whole night. And next day her father spoke. He said, "My child kept me awake by talking all night. Let some one look at my child." And when they went to look at her, they saw a man lying with her. Then they laid down a mat for them. And the woman came out. And when she had seated herself, the Human Head she had married came down after her. And after he had seated himself by her, they began to give them food. Then they watched to see how he would pick up the food. And when they put the food in front of them, the woman took it. And she ate. And the man's food also picked itself up. Going along by itself in the air, it disappeared. And after they had taken the dried food away from them, they also placed berries in front of them. And when they gave them spoons, they laid a spoon by the Head, and it picked itself up. Then the woman took the berries up with her spoon, and her husband also took them up. Going through the air, they disappeared. They did not see the man eat. They only saw the spoon carrying itself about.

And when night came on, they went to bed. Next morning, after they had gotten through eating, they went out and sat down outside. And the Half-Head lay beside her. And when the young men passed by, they laughed at them. And when night came, they again went to bed. Next morning, when the woman arose, she questioned her father. She said to her father, "Father, are you asleep?" When her father answered, she continued, "He is going hunting. Send three men with him." And her father told three men to go with him. And, the two spears picking themselves up, they started. As they went, they saw hair-seal, and landed behind them. And the two spears picked themselves up. Then he pierced the hair-seal with the spears. And when t-hose left behind saw it, they went to him. And after they had landed behind the hairseal, they took the Head into the canoe. Then the spears seized themselves, and he clubbed the hair-seal to death. They did not see his hands at all. They saw only his club. And the two men in the middle pulled in the hairseal. Going along from that place, he killed another. When he had killed four, the canoe was turned around. When he came back, the two spears picked themselves up and leaned themselves against the front of the house. Under the spears, as they came up, came the Human Head. He entered the house and went to his wife. And while they were pulling off the hairseal, he remained in the house. And next day he sat outside for a

And that evening they (HalfHead and his wife) went to bed. Next day, as they sat outside, the young men assembled. Then they gathered stones, and they also gathered sticks. And when they had come to them, they threw the stones. They did not throw stones at the woman. They threw stones only at the Skull. And he did not get angry. They collected big stones for him, and threw them at him. He was not broken. After they had thrown them at him for some time, he became angry. When he became angry, he ran (at them). And he cut off their arms. He also cut off their legs. He also chopped off their heads. He also broke their arms. He broke their legs as well. He smashed their heads. Afterwards this Hiead lay with his wife. When they became afraid of him, some of them ran into their houses in fright. And in the evening (he and his wife) came in again. Next day (the woman) told her father that her husband was again going to hunt. After her father had the spears fixed, they launched the canoe for him. And when this Head began to go down, the spears also carried themselves down with him. Then he got in, and they started off with him. After they had gone along for a while, they saw a hair-seal remaining a long time in one place. Then they landed; and when the Head got off, the spears also picked themselves up. And when

And after he had clubbed it to death, he shoved it towards the stern, and they took it into the canoe. Then he went on again, saw another, and speared it. And after they had clubbed it to death, they took it into the canoe. And they went off again. After he had killed four hair-seals, he turned back. After they had paddled back for a while, they landed. And when he went out, the spears also carried themselves up and ran up of themselves. The Human Head also went along in company.

And when he entered, his wife spoke to her father. She said, "Father, he says they speared four hair-seals." Only his wife heard his voice. The others, however, did not hear his voice. And the next morning he again went hunting. And after his canoe had gone along for a while, they came to a sleeping sea-otter. And he speared it. And after he had clubbed it to death, those in the stern took it in. And after they had started from this place, they came to another sleeping sea-otter. Then he speared that, and clubbed it to death. When he had killed four, they turned back. When they got back, the spears took themselves up. And

62. The Lost People of Yagun Inlet.

A town lay in Yagun Inlet.' And two women said things (bad enough) to make anybody angry. They said, "We eat good things; but other people eat bad things."' Not a long time afterward much snow fell, although it was not winter. And the snow rose over the houses. And there was no way to get fire-wood. Nor was there any way to get food. And the snow would not melt. Then some of them died of cold. Some of them also starved to death. All were in the same condition. As fast as their food was used up, they died. They starved to death, and they also died of cold.
And when one man in a certain house had almost frozen to death, he heard something say, "I, however, am warm." He did not know what spoke, because the people were all dead. And when he heard it speak again, he knew what the thing that spoke was. He knew that it was an old soft Mat lying in the corner. When the Mat said, "But I am warm," it moved. Then he knew it was the Mat that spoke. And by and by he put the Mat around himself, and became warm. Then he wanted to try to find salmon. And he went under the snow to a

And when he had taken four sticks from salal-bushes (?), he extracted the insides and put roots through them. And he tied them to the end of a stick. Then he shook them, and they made a noise. And he thought it was good. And where the salmon had made a hole, he pushed the stick into the ground at its tail. And he also placed the spear just over its middle, waiting for evening. Then he started home and was in the house. And in the evening he went there. And he sat at the butt-end of the spear. Not a long time before evening, the salal-stick made a noise. Then he seized the spear. And he drove the spear into (the hole). And it went through the middle of the salmon. And he went home with it. And he put it into the house. Before that time, he had ljept himself alive by chewing gum. Then he lighted a fire for the salmon. And he cooked a small part. The man's name was Wu'ltc!igas. All that time the snow did not melt. It was still deep over the house. By and by, after it had become light, he heard the song of the thrush. Then he quickly removed the Mat from his face, and looked through the smoke-hole. Then he saw a thrush sitting at the edge of the smoke-hole with a salmonberry in its mouth. Then he knew that it was summer, because he saw that the thrush had a salmon-berry in its mouth. And he was saved. And when he knew that it was sum-

And his wife said to him, "When you go, go farther. Then you will kill something." So the man thought. "When the wind is good, I will gp still farther," he thought. So, when it was fine weather, he again took his servants. Then he set out. This was the third time he had set out. Then he went beyond the place where he had turned back. Still he killed nothing. Then he wondered. Then he questioned his servants. "No, (let us go back,)" they said to their master in reply. "You say well. Take me back," said he to his servants. Then they came back to the town.

Then the people waited in a great crowd to meet him. They stood there in a crowd to meet him, because they thought, "Now he has killed many animals." And not one animal was to be seen in his canoe. They asked him, "Did you miss them?" He replied, "No." After that they pulled up his canoe. Then his wife also stood among them. When he looked towards his wife, her face was nicely covered with pitch. Then she went among the crowd with her husband. And they entered the house. At that time it was spring. Nothing was to be seen to eat, because they always got food from this hunter. But

now they thought, "We shall starve." They were very much disturbed in mind at it. He had gone out three times. But he had killed nothing. That was the way they thought. At that time the women gathered sk!ia'o-roots, which were good to eat, among the things from the woods. By means of those, their children were kept alive. While they were doing so, (the hunter) looked for a good day. Then one of his lucky days came. He started. But now the people of the town knew that he would kill something, because it was one of his lucky days. When the lucky day to kill things came, the ancient people used to bathe. They mentioned the name of the thing they wanted to kill. Sometimes they mentioned the name of the sea-otter. Somnetimes they mentioned the name of some hair-seal they wanted. Therefore this hunter did so before he started, for lhe did not know that his wife was doing something bad. So he performed this sacred duty. This was the fourth time he went. Then he went beyond the place whence he had returned the three times. Still he killed nothing. He returned. At that time he did not look around for anything. His mind was very much disturbed. The town of TI'An came in sight. The-y (the hunters) heard a drum. They listened. They heard (the people) singing sweet songs. They sang because they had sighted (the hunters). They sang because they thought that he now might have killed an animal. Then they turned their canoe around in front of the town. Some of them questioned him. Some of them sang.

They could not hear one another's voices. All of them rejoiced. Some of them came to understand that he had killed nothing, but only those people to whom he had told the news understood. But part of them did not hear, because they were singing much. They did not know. But after they had stopped singing, they came to know that he had killed nothing. Then, although their minds had been good, their minds became bad,' because there was nothing to eat. After this he went into the house to think it over. So he was in the house. Then he commanded his wife not to go and get things, as she had done formerly. But his wife did not obey him; and he thought about it and watched her, for he wanted to see how she acted. Then he considered. "Now I will fool her. I will tell her I am going to hunt. Then she will believe my word." So he spoke to her.

After he was through speaking to her as above, he set out. But at that time he pulled up his canoe at a bay named Sk!A'nstAs Bay, near the town. He pulled it far up into the woods, because he did not wish any one else to see it. (The servants) concealed it carefully. Afterwards he said to his servants, "Hide yourselves very carefully." All lay under the canoe. "But I will go to TI'An. And I will watch my wife. When I have seen how she acts, I will tell you. Now I am going to leave you. I may stay away for a long time.

Before he had sat there a long time, his wife put on the clothing she kept clean. At that time the clothing of women was made of soft, valuable skins. These he saw his wife puton. So he watched his wife closely. While he was looking at her, he saw her turn westward. He followed her. He kept her in sight.
At the foot of a place called Pileof-Stones was a narrow bay. Behind that was a grassy place. He saw his wife standing there. Then he heard her begin to sing. She also held a digging-stick. She beat upon a treetrunk with it. She beat very much. She made a loud noise. Her voice, too, was plainly to be heard. Her husband heard it. He learned her song.

While he was learning her song, a black whale came blowing from the open sea. After it had come up to blow once, it came up to blow nearer. Then the woman's singing was much louder. And when the whale came up to blow. its blowing also became much louder. The mind of the woman's husband was not disturbed, but he was very anxious to learn the songs. While he was trying to learn the songs, the whale came floating upon its back into the little bay. At that time the woman stopped singing. Then she jumped upon the whale. Then her

husband saw her sit down on it. Then he knew that his wife was doing a bad thing. After he had seen this, and learned the song, he returned towards his servants.
When he came to them, they asked him, What did you see?" So his " No, I canoe-men questioned him. saw nothing," he said to his servants. "It is good that we go back," he said to them. So they went back. When they got in front of the town, not one said anything. They had given it up, because, when their minds were good before, their joy came to nothing. So now they remembered. At that time their little children had begun to starve. So they did not now ask foolish questions of him. Then even the strong ones starved. They said, if he killed nothing, many of them might starve to death. Then the hunter took his spear and came out of the canoe. They saw that he looked happier.
"

Then his wife also camne to him. "Did you see nothing?" she asked of her husband. And he said to his wife, "Yes, I saw something." He spoke to his wife as he walked along. They entered the house. He said to his wife, "Let me eat the food you have reserved." After that he remained a while in the house. But afterwards he commanded his wife. He said to his wife, "Now I want you to go for the things you were in the habit of getting. Go up the inlet." She did as her husband told her. But that time

The thing they used at that time (i. e., the pointed wooden digging-stick) was what she took, and she set out. Then her husband, in turn, went westward to the place named Pile-ofStones. And he came to the grassy space. Then he sang his wife's song. He imitated his wife's voice. And he also beat upon the tree for a drum, as his wife had done. Before he had sung long, the whale came up to blow, as it had done before. Then it made a noise, as it had before. Then he also increased his voice, as his wife had done. Then the whale came up to blow nearer. Then it blew. He also raised his voice. He sang as he had heard the woman singing before. Then the man sang louder. He imitated his wife's voice. While he sang, the whale came up on its back in the little bay. Then he j'umped down upon it, as his wife had done.

He thought as follows. He threw down (the piece) unfil his wife should come. "I will cook it," he thought. So he took stones and piled them into the fire. Then he drew the steamingbox towards the fire. And he took wooden tongs for the stones. Then the stones were very hot. Then he put them into the box. He also cut up the piece of the whale and put it in. Then they did not know about covering it over with boards. They called them "mat-covers." He put them around it. He sat near it a while. When they became cold, he put other stones in. And after he thought it was cooked, he uncovered it entirely. He took (the stones) away. He saw that it was done. Ihen he piled (the pieces of meat) into a dish. Then he put it back behind a pile of things to cool. Then his wife was still away. He waited for his wife. Afterwards his wife came. Then he saw that his wife was very cold. He never had been angry with his wife. Now, when his wife was cold, he built a great fire in front of her. He told her the news as follows.

that he had not made her ashamed. But now he was going to make her eat part of her lover. He laid it in front of her. Then the woman was very hungry, because she had not eaten all day. But now she saw her husband put very good food in front of her. She took it, and she ate. She filled herself. But her husband did not eat with her, because he did not want to eat, but only wanted to make his wife ashamed. So he said to her, "Is the piece of your lover sweet?" So he spoke to his wife, and she fell back. And she died. He broke her feelings by his words. Then the women all heard of this. Then they were very much ashamed. So they said to one another, "A hunter's wife will not do that way again." So the women of TI'An were like that ever afterwards. Not one woman ever fooled her husband again. This is the story.

And while they were playing, something came among them. Its spine from head to hips was like the shell of a chiton. Its back on either side of this was black. When they played ball, it did not let (the ball) fall to the ground, for (the something) ran very fast. And they were astonished at it. They said, "Whip the thing that has come among us." So they whipped it. It did not feel it. But once they struck it hard on the head. It felt this. Then it ran down into the sea. This was one of the OceanPeople.' And he came out upon a stone in front of K!ungie'lAni. After he had lain there half out of water for a while, he went down. This was the spirit of the stone. And he was gone for good. And they ceased to see him. Then one seized the feather floating around above their heads. And it lifted him up. When he got up in the air, another seized him by the feet. When this one was also raised up, another seized his feet. They were unable to pull their hands away. Their hands stuck. It pulled up all the people of the town. At that time one little girl was saved. And she went about the town, weeping. In front of her uncle's house was a high platform over the sea. After she had walked about (the town) a while, she began to light the fires in the houses. When she was through lighting the fires, she went back and forth in the sand. And afterwards she sat upon the platform. Then she

the doorways. When he came home, he had seen empty houses. Then he questioned his mother. He said, " Why are these houses empty?""Because something pulled your uncles up." - "What did it?" he asked her. "Something hanging from above with a feather at the end did it." - "What was it they played with down here?" said he to her. "The thing your uncles were playing with is in the house." "Show it to me," he said to her. And she handed it to him. "How did they play with it?" - When the tide was low, they went down to the beach to play. They threw it up, and ran after it," she said to him. "I will also play with it," said he to his mother. His mother did not think the feather would come down again. Then, when the tide was low, he went down to play with it. Then, when he threw it up as his mother had told him, he kept striking it. After he had done this for a while, the thing again came down. And although it was above his head, he did not touch it. And in the evening he walked home. Then he questioned his mother. "Mother, was that the thing you spoke about?" he said to his mother. "That was it," said she to him. "Will you let me seize it?" he said to his mother. "Don't, my son, you are very small," said his mother to him. "No, let me take hold of it," he said. She said to her son, "It is not good for you to seize it and have something pull you up." "No, to-morrow I shall seize it," said he to her. "The thing pulled up your uncles, although they were many," said she to her son.

A good hunter went hunting from House-Point-Town.2 There were four in the canoe. They hunted, and killed nothing. The harpooneer said, "I will kill something, although it be in the house of The-One-in-the-Sea.3 They- came back with an empty canoe, and presently, when it was calm, went hunting again. All that time they did not kill a single thing. By and by a fog came upon them in the open sea. And while it was still foggy, evening came. And each of them went to sleep in the canoe. They slept; and while they were asleep, they were taken into the house of The-One-inthe-Sea, along with the canoe. And in the morning they found themselves in a very strange house. The house

The-One-in-the-Sea was a very large person. He was like a human being. All of the Ocean-People' were like him. Then Knowing-the-Places opened his box, and they hunted in it. And they found his deer-tallow in it. And the chief was very glad to see it. And he told them to bring it. And they placed the deer-tallow behind where he sat, upon some clean thing. And he said, "Now call all the chiefs of the Around-the-Sea-People.2 Also call Southeast," he said. He sent for the chiefs of the Ocean-People, because he was going to give away the tallow. And they began to come in to the feast. When they entered, the tide began to rush in. And they came in blowing. And as soon as they had entered, they came out of their skins. And they were carried against the walls of the house by the tide. And after they had become like human beings, they sat down. And after all were in, the tide drew itself out again. But Southeast' had not come yet. When he was about to enter, the wind' rushed in violently. And big pieces of seaweed and big pieces of gravel blew into the house. Afterwards he himself entered. When he first came, there were black stripes upon his face like clouds. After those had disappeared, clouds, partly black

And after this took place, when the southeast wind blew, his face became like the breast of a sparrow. And presently, when the Around-the-Sea-People saw it, they were very much ashamed. They also wondered. And after that, The-One-in-the-Sea was going to give them the tallow. And he told them to put down big clean things for them. And he told them to chop up the tallow. And the Around-the-Sea-People thought, "Why did he call us in for such a small piece of tallow, when there are so many of us?" And the one who sees what people think, who always stays in his house, spoke. Hie said, "Do not think so. Some will be left over." And the Around-the-Sea-People were again very much ashamed, because he knew what they thought. And after that, he -began to give them the tallow. And some of it was left over. And he began giving to them again. And the little that was left over he took for himself. He made the tallow grow. And when they started out, they entered their skins again. And the tide came in for them again. And again they started away, blowing. And all went out. And the tide again drew itself out. And Southeast went out after them.

After all had gone out, the human beings were left in their canoe. Then Knowing-the-Places thought, "Perhaps (The-One-in-the-Sea) is taking us for himself." They did not even take a paddle from him. (The human beings) staid in their canoe. They did not want to turn them into supernatural beings. Then he who sees people's thoughts told The-One-in-the-Sea what Knowing-the-Places thought. AndTheOne-in-the-Sea replied, "I have not taken them in for myself. I let them see the inside of my house on account of their small words. To-morrow I shall put them outside," he said. And next morning they were floating And they went to upon the sea. their place. And they arrived at their own place. They had not staid a long time in the house of The-Onein-the-Sea. And when they came to their own place, they told what had been done to them. "Mrhe-One-in-the Sea took some deer-tallow that was in my box. And he sent to call in the Ocean-People," he said. " And he sent for Southeast with them. Then Southeast performed great wonders. He surpassed all the OceanPeople. These Ocean-People are persons like us. Only when they go for food do they enter their skins," they said. "And one saw what we were thinking. And he told the chief about it. And the chief said, 'I shall put them outside to-morrow.'

He only wanted us to see the inside of his house," they said. When they were through telling about themselves, they went hunting again one calm morning. They went out hunting four times. And they did not kill the smallest thing. When they reached home again, his (Knowingthe-Places') friends went down to see them. And one of his friends said to him, "Why have you always come home with an empty canoe for such a long time?" - "A Sea-Anemone is in my canoe," he said. And presently, when it was calm, they set out during the night. After he had gone along for a while, Knowing-the-Places looked down into the sea. And he saw a Sea-Anemone upon a rock. And he saw the flipper of a hair-seal sticking out from the middle of it. And he took it in. And that night they camped in an uninhabited place in order to eat the hair-seal flipper. And in the evening they steamed the hair-seal flipper. And after it had steamed for a while, it was done, and they stopped. And they ate. And they slept while it was still night, for they wanted to start off next morning. So they started hunting very early. They went while it was still dark. And as they were going along, a big person came to them by canoe. He wore a big hat. His hat was painted. Sea-Anemone's canoe was full of hair-

Then the big person opened his box. He went to get something in it, and took pounded cedarbark out of it. And he said to (the hunter), ."Put your face near me." He put his face near (the big person), and put the pounded cedar-bark into his eyes. Blood flowed out of his eyes. The pounded cedar-bark was soaked with blood. Then Sea-Anemone put the pounded cedar-bark into the sea and washed his hands. And he again went to his box to get pounded cedarbark. And again he said to him, "Bring your face near." And again he touched his eyes. But that time not much blood came out. Then he said to him, "Clean your eyes." And he cleaned his eyes. Then Sea-Anemone said to the man, ,"Look into the water!" And he looked into the sea. And he saw two towns in the sea. And Sea-Anemone said to Knowing-the-Places, "Now you wTill cease to come home with an empty canoe. Wherever you go, you will spear hair-seal. Your canoe will always be full. I am helping you," said he to him. Then Sea-Anemone left him. Knowing-the-Places also started away. His eyes had been filled with blood, and he saw nothing, because a menstruant woman had passed in front of him.

And when he left him, he began to spear hair-seal in the places where he had formerly gone. And his canoe was full by noon. And he came back. And he arrived at his own town while it was still light. Then he began to give a whole hair-seal to his wife's friends. And some was left over. And the man also began to give to his friends. And he gave all of the one he had kept for himself to all his friends. After that they paid him a great deal. All paid him. The town where he lived was big. And presently, when it was very calm, he started off while it was still dark. And he again began to spear and pull in hair-seal where he was in the habit of hunting for them. And when evening came, his canoe was full. His canoe was very full. And he started back. And at dark he came to the town. And they carried up his hair-seal. And they went to sleep. And he thought. "I want the morning to come quickly, so that I may again give the hair-seal to my brothersin-law." So, when day came, he gave the hair-seal to his brothers-in-law. And there were again many left over. And he also gave some to his own friends. He gave to the whole town. And he again kept one for himself. And again the whole town began to pay him. The-One-in-the-Sea took him in and took his grease, and called the Around-the-Sea-People for it. So he helped him in return. Therefore, when (Knowing-the-Places) came back, he had Sea-Anemone restore his sight. He helped him at the wish of TheOne-in-the-Sea.

68. The Man who

was

helped by Land-Otters.'

A man lived opposite Ship Island.2 He made a canoe. Every evening when he came home, (he and his family) wished some one might present them with fresh fish. A dead woman lay near them. She gave to them. She picked up crab-shells lying by her side, and gave them to them. And they were very much pleased with them. Then they tied (a string made of) slivers of cedar-bark to her blanket, because they wanted to know where she came from. Next morning he walked along upon it. And he saw that the string hung from the grave-box. Then they knew who gave them food. And when she gave them food the next time, she said [to him], "When your canoe is finished, your brothersin-law say they will pull it out." And when she again gave them food, he told her that the canoe was finished, and he had put in the temporary cross-pieces. She said, " Go to the canoe before your brothers-in-law (go)." And next day he went into the woods before them. And they pulled -out his canoe. The Land-Otter (the woman) she had married began to help him. Then (the man and his family) went off with them, and camped with them at Alder-Point-fronting-the-Sea. Next day (the Land-Otters).went fishing with (the hunter). When the canoes were very full, they came back. And they split (the fish), and hung them up to dry. Then they made a fire under them and dried them.

Now we are

going to hear Ga'ogal's

story.

His father was the chief of the town.2 Ga'ogal's uncles also lived there. At that time they married only their uncles' children. They did not want others to take the things their uncles owned. Therefore (a man) did not allow any one else to marry his uncle's child.

So Ga'ogal, the town-chief's son, also thought. So he worked for his uncle's daughter. His uncle's daughter also wanted him. But still another chief's son also wanted to marry this woman. She wanted both of the men. Not a long time afterward she (began to) dislike Ga'ogal. She considered about him. "I will marry you, if you pull out your eyebrows." And Ga'ogal did as the woman said. Then she wanted to tell him still other plans. She said to him, "Pull out your eyelashes also. Then I will marry you." And he did as she said. Still she did not marry him after that. She also wished to have him do other things. "Pull out the hair of your head. When it is all pulled out, I will marry you," she said to her intended husband. So Ga'ogal did. At that time the minds of chiefs' children were very strong. Therefore he did as the woman he was going to marry said. At this time, Ga'ogal could not be recognized. But still the woman did not have pity on him. This was the last time she was going to make him do something. She said to her intended husband, "Pull off all the hair from your entire body." So Ga'ogal did. But then the woman ran away from him in terror.
At that time people were all naked. Therefore Ga'ogal was very much ashamed of himself. He thought, " Now I will not go to my father's town." So he thought. He ascended Mount Q!a'gan. At that time people used to eat devil's-club. They used to do so because they said, when one ate devil's-

club, he found one of the valuable things in the sea. That is what they used to say. They say that this (valuable thing in the sea) was a seaotter. So, although the devil's-club was a hard thing to eat, they ate it. Ga'ogal also did so. He was like one who is dead. The people of his father's town saw him no nmore. Then he went around the island. Q!a'gan was an island. So he hunted around it for dead animals. Before he had gone far, he came to where a sea-lion was sitting. He picked up a strong piece of driftwood. He took this (in order to kill it). H-e crawled down stealthily towards the ocean. He came to it from the seaside. There was no way by which the sea-lion could save itself, for he ((Ga'ogal) came upon it from the seaside. Thus he acted toward it. He aimed a blow at it. He struck it on the weakest part of the head. And he clubbed it to death. Then he was happy. He thought, "I have killed this valuable animal because I ate so much devil's-club." So he thought. Then he skinned it in one piece. He carried it up. He stuffed it with moss inside. Then he dried it in the sunshine. Before he had worked at it for a long time, he had it dried. At that time, Qa'ogal's hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes had not grown again. The hair on all parts of his body, that she had told him to pull out, had not grown again. Not a single person had seen him since. But still Ga'ogal was a handy inan. So he took his knife. And he took off the sea-lion's skin neatly. He

dried it well for a while. But afterwards he thought what he shoulld do with it. "I shall get inside of it. And I shall sew the place together where I took off the skin." So he did. Then he tried it on, as he had planned. He went into the sea with it. Then he dived. He did not go far under water. He floated back. Still he did not give up. He tried it again, and he floated up again. After he had done this four times, he gave it up. Then he climbed up upon the stone. Then he cut himself loose at the tail-end, where it had been sewed.

Then he came out, and he took up the sea-lion-skin. He had found a good place for it back among the trees. There he hung it. He lay down right under it. He drew some article of clothing around his head. He did this in order to think. Before he had thought long, it came to his mind. He thought, "Let me put four stones inside." Then he pulled (the skin) down, and went into it at the same place as formerly. He did as he had thought. He took four good-sized stones and put them on the ventral side of its body. He sewed the opening at the tail together, as he had done before. He finished it. Then he jumped in. At once he tried to dive. He did not float up very much. After a while he dived under the water. But he floated up as he had done before. Then he was happy. He went up to the shore again. Then he again cut apart the place at the tail which was sewed together. He

They put their arrows, bows, war-spears, and other things with which to kill him, into their canoes. This is how they did.

Then they called to one another. "This animal is very wise,' said all these families to one another. But some of them said, "Try to kill him." At that time, all pulled hard together to kill him. Then they shot him more than they had done before. Some of the men still had some spears in their canoes. They speared him with those. Now he came into a deep place.

such things. Therefore he was glad about it. Then he remembered what he had done before. He remembered what he had done when he first pulled out the hair of his head and eyebrows. At that time, by eating a great deal of devil's-club, he thought he had gained these things. He remained there for a while. Again he prepared to start back. He hid these arrows, war-spears, and hunting-spears. Afterwards he swam thither again. At that time they began to boil olachen. They saw him, while he was still coming, swimming far off at the mouth of the river. They called the attention of the people to him. They said, "The sea-lion is coming again." So all shouted together. All said, "It is not good to have him take all of our arrows, hunting-spears, and war-spears." They said afterwards, "It it good to kill him." So they tried hard to get him.
Then the canoes were so close upon him that no water was to be seen anywhere between. He came up where there was a little space. Then they speared him and shot at him from those canoes that were alongside. Again he went away. And where there was another small space, he again came up.

had taken into the woods. He also put the skin of the sea-lion back where it used to hang. He remained there for a while. But then his hair became long;. Again he went to the place where he had eaten devil's-club. Then he sat there. It was a fine day. Then he looked about. He looked out on the open sea. At that time (his people) did not know of these islands. The mountains were also seen. At that time it was summer. It was the time when they went to get things. Therefore he did not go to his father's town. HIe knew that there was no one there. So he always staid where his sea-lion-skin hung. He saw this land. He did not forget it. When another fine day came, he put on his skin again. Then he swam away. He made straight for the land he had seen. Before he had swum far, he came in sight of the land. Then he was glad. When he got near the land, he saw that there were no small islands about it. He also came in sight of the town (Masset proper). He saw another town on the opposite side (Yan). He swam towards them for a while. Another town (Kayang) came in sight. The people of these three towns said the same thing as the people had said when he swam up Nass Inlet. They said at the three towns, "Go out and get him." So some of them put their arrows, spears, war-spears, and bows into their canoes. They paddled after him. They shot at him. At that time the tide was flowing up the inlet. In chasing him, they went halfway up the inlet. From there they

chased him back. Still they could not get him. Then some of them gave it up. And they spoke like this. They said, "This is a wonderful animal." All came ashore. They did so, because they had given him up.
But he did not then go back. He examined this place. When night came on, he landed on the sand behind the town. And he came out of his skin. He took all the things used as arrows, - the things used as hunting-spearheads, and the things used as warspear-heads, - which he had carried away up to the woods. And he also hid his skin there. After he had done this, night was coming on. After he was through doing so, he went to look at the town. He saw many people outside. He was among them. But still they did not know about him. He also heardthem singing songs. Still he did not know the words that they put into them. This chief's son did not know their language. So he did not know what they said. Trusting to chance, he hunted about in the middle of the town. He knew that the town-chief's house should stand in the middle. So he hunted there. Just so he saw a big house standing in the middle. He looked in. The chief's daughter sat under the screens pointing towards each other, which stood in the rear of the house. Just before they went to bed, he started back. He came to where he had hidden his skin. Then he slept there. The next day it was very fine weather. Still he did not go anywhere. He

remained there all day. Night came on. Then the tide was coming in. He entered his skin. He thought, "I shall again swim for their arrows, hunting-spears, and war-spears." So he did. When they saw him, they called out, as they had done before. They said, "The sea-lion is swimming about again." So the three towns said. Therefore they pulled their canoes into the water again. They chased him halfway up the inlet in their endeavors to kill him, as they had done before. They chased him down again. At that time all their weapons were exhausted. Now it had become night. Then he again came out of his skin where he had come ashore before. Then, when darkness came on, he came to the town again. He went about among (the houses), as he had gone before. But he did not care whether he was killed or not. He thought like this. " I shall do so. I shall go in near the town-chief's daughter." And he did as he had thought. When all were asleep, he entered the house. He sat at the head of the chief's daughter. He awoke her. The woman woke up. She whispered, "Who did this?" She did not want to make the man ashamed. So she asked him in a whisper. The man did not understand what the woman said to him. Trusting to chance, he mentioned his name. "I am Ga'ogat," he said. The woman, in turn, did not understand what the man said. Trusting to chance, she pulled him towards her. Then the man thought, "It is going to be so."

He thought she had agreed to marry him. So he lifted the blanket and lay down by her side. At that time, when people married, they did not do so in a regular manner. He did this way. They could not talk together, because they could not speak each other's language. As they lay without speaking, day dawned. The chief awoke. He questioned his daughter. "Child, who spoke with you for a long time last night?" he said to his daughter. Then she said to her father, " I do not know anything about him." Thus she spoke to her father. Then the chief ordered the fire to be lighted. "Now lay down a mat for my child's husband." And they did as he had said. " Now, child, come down and sit by the fire with your husband." They arose and did so. There were very many people in the house. They saw that the man had a fine appearance. His hair was longer than that of any of the other people. His father-in-law's mind was pleased. He said, " Child, travel about by my side presently, with your husband, in the canoe lying on the beach." Thus he spoke to his daughter. After he had staid with his wife for a while, he came to know his wife's language. Then they were very happy. He said to his wife, "I shall leave you for a while." His wife agreed. When night came on, he left his wife. He came to the place where he had concealed the war-spears, hunting-spears, and arrows, and where his skin also was. He put it on. Then he returned towards Q!a'gan. He came ashore where he had first killed the sea-lion.

Then he took all the things he had carried away from Nass Inlet. He took the arrows, hunting-spears, and war-spears. He put them into his skin. Afterwards he entered it. He jumped from the land, as he had done before. Next night he came ashore again where his wife lived. He sat for a while where he had hidden his skin. He waited there till night. Then night came on. But then he took the things. He carried them on his back. He hid them belhind the house. He entered. Then his father-in-law was very glad to see him. He had given him up. So, when he again saw him come in to his daughter, he was glad. When all were asleep, he carried into the house the things he had brought. His wife questioned him. She said to her husband, "What have you?" He said to his wife, "They are things I am going to give to your father." Next day early he and his wife got up. He said to his wife, "Tell your father to get up." So she spoke to her father. So the chief did. Then she took these things out first in front of her father. The chief only wondered. "PropertyWoman 1 gave them to me." That is what he thought. Then he gave his son-in-law five slaves. He also gave his daughter five. Together they had ten. At that time they were going to find out about tobacco. So they found this tobacco. He and his wife learned how it was cultivated. They learned quickly. Their ten slaves also worked hard with them. They knew it was good to chew. So they wished to get much.

Now fall came on. At that time he began to tell his wife about himself. His wife's mind was very sick. Then she told her father. His fatherin-law's mind was also very sick over it. And he said to his daughter, "Child, tell your husband to go to his father's country.' Then the chief's son's mind was good. He questioned his wife. "What is the name of your father's town?" said he to her. She told him the name. She said to him, "Its name is White-Slope (Masset)." Then they prepared to go. In the evening he went to get the things he had concealed on the other side. He did not want other people to see them, for they were the things of the people of White-Slope. Now they started off. She said to her husband, "Meet them as they meet you." Then she told her husband what he should do. Now he came to his father's town. When they came to recognize him, they were much troubled. Many years had passed since his death. That was why they were troubled. His father bit his skin to see whether he were dreaming. They shouted a great deal. His uncles' daughters also came out to meet him. Ga'ogal was finer-looking than before. His hair had become red. This is what made his face look well. Next day he called the one who had ordered him to pull out his hair behind the town. The woman agreed at once. She forgot what she had made her father's nephew do. Gxa'ogal spoke like this. "Lie down before me," he said to her. So the woman did. Then he put his foot into a place

7O. The Bear-Hunters.2

At People's-Town3 was a great crowd of people. And ten of these were good bear-hunters. They hunted in Yagun Inlet.4 There were then no salmon in the river. They went up in two canoes. And their dead-falls were set in the bear-trails. At that time they banished an old woman and her grandson. Then the old woman lived with her grandson above the town. Then his uncles went up to see their dead-falls. And they And they only saw a bear in each. threw away the entrails. But when the insides were cleaned, they took (the carcasses) to the river. When they had them near their canoes, they put them on board. And in one In the other were canoe were five. five more. Then they started down with them. Then all reached the town

At that time they did not give food to the one they had banished and his grandmother. Then they had nothing to eat. When they cut them up, this boy watched. As he looked, he said to his grandmother, "My uncles are cutting up the bears they brought from far off." - "Say! grandchild, would it not be well for ine to go down?" she said. "No," he said to his grandmother. Now she thought they would give some to her. At that time one of his uncles' children, a little girl about so high (indicated), brought a small piece up to them inside of her blanket. She did not do it before their faces (openly). And his grandmother cooked this for (the boy), who asked the girl, "Does your mother give this to us?" The little girl said, "No." She brought it secretly. And she returned home. And she also brought them fire in the inside of her blanket. She brought it in mussel-shells. Thein the girl said, "I will always bring you this fire." Then they went up to see their deadfalls again. And they got up there. Then they went to look at all of their dead-falls. At that time there was again a bear in each dead-fall. There were ten (dead-falls). And there were also ten bears. And then they took the bears out. Again they threw the entrails away. Then they took the bears out to their canoes. And then they put them into their canoes. And they started down with them. And

they reached the town. Then they put all the bears off on the beach. The boy saw them. And when he went in, he told his grandmother. At that time they again cut up the bears. At that time there was again plenty of fat and meat in the whole town. (The boy) said to his grandmother, "Do not go down to them." Then the same one of his uncles' children that did it before again brought up meat to them. But at that time he questioned his grandmother. He was small, so that he did not know about the things in which his uncles killed bears. "What is the thing in which they kill them like?" he asked his grandmother. " Have not you heard them tell about it?" he said. His grandmother said to him, "Yes, grandchild, I used to hear them tell about it." - "Can I make it?" he said. His grandmother said to him, "Do you want to make one?" Then he said, "Yes." His grandmothersaid to him, "Your body is too small, grandchild. Now, let me teach you," said his grandmother to him. "Cut down the salmon-berry-bushes growing outside." All this time his uncles were bringing down bears from their deadfalls. Then small pieces of cedar-bark lay near his grandmother. And his grandmother broke them up fine with her fingers. And every time they brought bears from above, his uncle's child brought him a small piece of meat. Then his grandmother told him to come over to her. Then she pushed the salmon-berry-bushes into the ground. She taught him how a dead-fall was made. As soon as she had pushed

And he watched his grandmother make it. And he knew how. "Go and get twisted cedar-limbs," said his grandmother to him. And he went for them. Then he took the cedar-limbs. And he had many. And when he had many, he went home. When he got there, he entered. He said, "Look, grandmother, shall I put them into, the fire (to take off the bark)?" - "Don't, grandchild," she said to him. But then he twisted them while they were still raw. While he was still doing this, evening came. Then all were finished. And part of the broken cedar-bark was left over. Then he took this, and said to his grandmother, "Twist this together." Then she began to twist it. And she finished. Then she said to him, "Say! what is this for, grandchild?" - "To bind the cedar-limbs," he said to her. Then he bound them with these. While he was still at it, evening came. Then he made a handle with part of the rope (to put the limbs on his back). Then he fastened a stone axe to it (the bundle). And after he had put the cedar-limbs upon his back, he went up on foot along the bank of the river. He went up along the hither side, Then he came to a beartrail. And he went along in this trail. Then he saw his uncles' dead-falls in it. And he went still farther up. Then he came to another- bear-trail. And as he went along in this one, he saw

Then he came to a mountain far inland. The mountain was named Red-HuckleberryBush-Mountain. Then he came upon a wide bear-track under it. And he began to set up his dead-fall there. And while he was making it, evening came. But the day after, he worked upon it again. Then it was completed. And he started home. And he got home to his grandmother. Then the people of the town were hungry. He said to her, "Search for a grave-box behind the town. Take the four side-planks." And his grandmother went thither. Then she came to many grave-boxes. And she poured the bones out of one. Then she pulled it apart, placed the pieces one upon another, and put them upon her shoulder. Then she started home with them. And she carried them into the house to her grandson. And the fire was in front of him. And he put the pieces of the grave-box around himself. He said to his grandmother, "Do not pass in front of me." At that time he lay (or slept) in this. After ten days, he went to look at his dead-fall. When he looked at it, a big bear was in it. And he took off the tree-trunks. And when the tree-trunks were all removed, he seized it by one arm. And he was unable to pull it out. It was very heavy. And he wanted to take its entrails out from it inside of the dead-fall.

just as he was about to cut it open, he was rebuked. "Don't," said the Trees, the Ground, and all kinds of Bushes. And the Ground also shook when these made a noise. And he was afraid to cut it open. Then he sat down. He could not see how to do it. Then, while he sat over him, something began to come out from his (the man's) belly. When it had reached his mouth, a song began to come out of his mouth. And it was the bear that put what he sang into his mind. So he sang above it. 'I shook my head as I walked around the island; cut me open upon my belly, hali'xias' a," he sang. The Forest-People 2 did not want him to cut it open without singing. Therefore something rebuked him when he was about to cut it -open, until the song had come out of his throat. Then he cut it open towards himself. Then it was as light as a feather. But then he put it upon a knoll. And he put a handle to it there. Then he went to his dead-fall and began to reset it. After it was finished, he cut open his (bear). At that time the Ground did not speak to him. He cut it open towards himself. Just as he' was about to cut it open, something out of the ground said to him, From yourself." But then he cut it open from himself. But afterwards he cut it open in any way. Then he began to take out its entrails. And he laid them right there.

And he went to the stream with them. Then he put them gently into the stream to see whether the Ground would speak to him again. And the Ground did not speak to him. So he put them into the brook. But then he went to the bear which he had placed upon the knoll. And he laid it on his back. And after he had gone along for a while, he became tired, and rested upon a little knoll. Then he sat upon it. His legs were thoroughly tired. When his legs were stronger, he tried to stand up again. And he could not. It was very heavy. Only his body moved. Then something again began to come out of his throat. He was as when one wants to hiccough. Then the song came quickly out of his mouth. And he sang again. This song was soft. It was the Black-Bear who put this song into his mind. "Chief walking with wobbling head (i. e., the Bear), make yourself light." The words of the song were like this. Then he stood up. Then it was not heavy in the least. And he carried it on his back to his grandmother. Then he told his grandmother to cut it up after she had taken its skin off. As she cut off thin slices of meat, his grandmother hung them up. And his uncles went to see theirs (the dead-falls). And they looked at them. And not a thing was to be seen in them. And they came down from them.

And after the boy had again lain for ten days, and ten days were consumed, he went up to see his (deadfall) again. And he came up to it. One (bear) was in it. And he took it out. Only the one he first killed was hard for him. Then he laid it near by. Then he remade his dead-fall, and stood it up. Then he went to this bear. He knew how to cut it open. So he cut this one open from himself. Then he began to put a handle on it. Then he carried it on his back. At that time, too, it was not heavy for him. And after he had gone along for a while, he rested himself upon the same knoll where he had rested before. He never went past it. But after that, he went on with it again. And he threw it down in front of the place where his grandmother lived. Then his grandmother took off the skin. And afterwards his grandmother cut up the meat. And his uncles ceased to kill bears. Then the little girl who used to bring him a piece of meat came to him. Then she saw his great quantity of meat. But he did not give her any to eat. And the girl went away from him. The people of the town were very hungry, because they had killed no bears. His uncles ceased to kill bears, because he had placed his dead-fall in the wide trail. So they were very hungry. Then the little girl told them about his great quantity of meat. And they wanted to buy it. Then they bought a great deal of it. And when ten days more were passed, he went to see his (dead-fall)

one was a boy. And when they (the people) came in from fishing, they did not give them (the children) food. And in the evening, when they went to bed, the blind man wept continually, because his brothers-in-law did not give food to his children. Next day, the wind being good, they went fishing again. Then all again refused to take him. The woman laid her husband's mat near the canoe of the youngest. And she went up to the house and took her husband by the hand. And she started to lead him out to the canoe. Then they started off from him. Again she went down to get her husband's mat. While his wife was gone down to get it, he crawled up between the houses. He had a hat on. And he crawled into the woods by himself. He crawled about aimlessly, not knowing whither he was going. Then he felt that it was evening. After it had been dark for a while, morning came again. Meanwhile his wife was in the house. She did not know whither her husband had gone. And morning again dawned upon the man in the forest. Again he began to crawl aimlessly about. After he had crawled along for a while, night came upon him. And day again dawned upon him. When the raven called, he knew that morning was coming. And when the raven ceased to call, he knew it was again evening. Then he heard the sound of some voice. And he crawled straight towards it. While he was still crawling thither, night came on.

Then (the chief) was going to give him food. He first gave him Nass River olachen to eat. He said to him, "I give you these Nass olachen to eat." After that he gave him Stikine olachen to eat. He said to him, 'I give you Stikine olachen to eat." Afterwards he gave him Skeena salmon-eggs to eat. He said to him, 'I give you Skeena River salmon-eggs to eat." And after that, he said to him, "When they again go fishing, they will keep refusing to take you." And he also questioned him. He said to him, "Do you own a canoe?" (The man) said to him, 'I have a canoe.""Do you also own an anchor-line?" he said to him. "Yes, chief, I have an anchor-line," he replied to him. And (the chief) questioned him again. He said to him, "Have you any children?" He replied to him, "Yes, chief, I have two children. One is a girl and one is a boy." After that the chief asked for his box. And they gave it to him. And when they brought it before him, he opened it. And he also opened one inside of that. And the house was filled with the many (boxes) he took out of this one box. When the house was filled with them, he came to a small one. But then this person put it under his arm. Now the man was about to start. Then (the chief) again instructed him. "When you get home, tell your wife to make a medium-sized basket. When the basket is done and they have refused to take you fishing many times, you and your wife launch your canoe. And take your two children with you.

And when you have launched the canoe, tell your wife to tie (a stone) to your anchor-line in the house. And do not let them know that you can see things. Although you can see things, do not let your wife know. When they go fishing, get your wife to ask them to take you fishing. And when they will not take you, have your two children get into the bow (of your own canoe). And take the basket with you also. And lay it behind yourself. Do not let your two children see it." Thus he spoke to him. "When they refuse to take you fishing, go out without bait. And listen as you go out. Then some one will speak to you. When he says to you, 'That is enough,' drop your anchor-line. Afterwards turn towards the stern," he said to him. "Then say, 'Give me bait.'' And when you have said, 'Give me bait,' olachen will pour into your basket. And while you are turned towards the stern, tie an olachen to the hook. And while you are still looking towards the stern, drop your hook down into the sea," said he to him. "When the house is filled with halibut, tell your wife to keep all of the parts. When the whole house is filled with dried halibut, the wind will blow continually from the sea," he said to him. "When it blows continually from the sea, and the town-people themselves are in trouble, they will come to you. And they will try to sell you slaves. Then give five strips of halibut for a slave. And when they bring you a copper, give five strips of halibut for it. When

"Now you shall go. When you go, do not look about near you. If anything makes a noise near you, do not look towards it. Only look in the direction you are taking. If you look near by, you will come into the same condition that you were formerly in. After you have given nine potlatches, pull the box out from under your clothing. And have your son look inside. After that, have his sister look in too. Then your son will become a chief. The woman, too, will become a chief-woman." Thus he was told. "When you come behind the house, crawl along," he said to him. Then (the man) started away from him. After he had gone on for a while, and night was come upon him, he sat down. And he did not look about. And in the morning he started on again. After he had gone along for a while, he came behind the house. And he only crawled out (of the woods). His helper had also said to him, 'If one blind like you comes here, his eyes will rot away." (The man) entered his house. After he had eaten, he said to his wife, "Make .a medium-sized basket." And it was evening. And in the morning (the people) went fishing again. And she again asked them to take her husband. Then they all went away from him. Then he and his wife launched his canoe. And she tied on the stone for him. And when his two children had gotten in with him, they went out.

He went fishing without bait. And as he went out, he listened. He heard some one say to him, "That is enough." Then he let down his anchor-line. Then he gave the rope to his children.

Then he turned towards the stern. When he heard a noise above him, he said, "Give me bait." Then the olachen poured into his basket. Then he tied an olachen to his hook. And he let it down. When it reached the bottom, it was bitten. And he began to catch them (fish). And he filled the canoe. And while his brothersin-law were out, he went home. And when he laiided, he put (the fish) off. Then he said to his wife, " Do not throw any of the parts away. Throw only the entrails away." And the woman did not throw any away. And as she cut them up, she dried them. As long as there vas a good wind, he fished. As fast as (the fish) were dried, she bundled them up. When their house was quite full, bad weather set in. The bad weather lasted for a long-time. Then the people of the town were troubled about themselves. When their children were almost starved, they began to buy from him with slaves. Then he gave five strips of halibut for one. For a copper he also gave five strips of halibut. He gave two and a half for an elk-skin blanket. Afterwards he gave three and a half for a slave. For every copper, he also gave three and a half strips. For an elk-skin blanket, he also gave a strip and a half. All the time he was buying with halibut, he potlatched.

Then he called for his son. And he pulled out his box. And he made him look into 'it. Then he said to him, "You will be a chief." And he also called for the woman. And he made her look into the box as well. He said to her, "You will be a chief-woman." And he also made his wife look into it. "Let no one do like me," he said. "His eyes will become rotten just behind (the houses). - You will also become a chief-woman," he said to his wife. When he also looked in, he said, "But I shall burst with riches." After this he potlatched again. He said, "I am making the last potlatch." Then he gave out many things. He finished giving away. And after all had gone away, he burst. And a certain one did as he had done before. And his eyes became rotten just back of the house.

"Call them into my house. Cook food," he said. So they did. And they again cooked the thing that had come ashore. When it was done, he said, "Tell them to come in." So, when the food was done, they called them. "The food is done," they said. Then he asked, "Have they entered?" "Yes," said one. "Is there room for them?" he said. "Yes," they said. (The chiefs) said, "Now let us go home." He said, "Pray eat food with me." Then all got in. And when they were seated, they were given food. When they were through eating, St!a'stA spoke to them. "When two days are passed, go to gA'lu; to dry salmon. To-morrow one of my coppers will be hidden," he said. The name of this copper was Whale-Copper. Then one named War-Talker hid it.

Then the wind was good. And they came to their town. Then (St!a'stA) told the one who had hidden his copper to go and get it. He went thither. And he did not find it. And when he came back, he told them about it. (St!a'stA) said to him, "Did you find the place where you put it?" "I put it under a hollowed-out rock," he said. It was truly lost. Then he called all for it. "Now find my copper," he said. So all went there. Then they searched diligently around the place where it had been hidden. And they could not find it. Then He-whose-Property-makes-a-Noise began to eat medicine. At the same time he also drank sea-water. All that time he went without fresh water. After he had done this for a time, after a long time, he went to hunt for the copper. He ate medicine because he wanted to find the copper. And when he could not find it, he ate medicine there. And he remained there all night. Then he heard it sing. At that time he thought he would see it. It sang near him. This copper sang. Then he began to hunt for it where it sang. And he looked about for it. But he learned its song. And then he came back. Then he told St!a'stA about it. He said, "I heard it singing." Hie said to him, "Do you know the song?" And he told him he did. He said to him, "Did it put words to the song?"

While coming down, he had a blanket around it. Then he tried to find a shelter behind the canoe. He looked for a big tree. And he came to a big tree. Then he took old' cedar-bark off from it. Then there was a great deal. And he also found sticks. And there were very many sticks.

Then he pushed a post into the ground, and farther off he put in another. Then he put cross-beams on top of them. And then he drove sticks into the ground around them. And he laid the roof-timbers upon them. And he fastened the ends of the rafters to the posts. He did it by means of roots. Then he placed small sticks upon (the rafters). He fastened these small sticks also with (roots). And he finished (laying them). Afterwards he laid cedar-bark upon them. And he finished the roof. Afterwards he made the walls. And he finished all. And then he put the copper into the house along with the marten-skin blankets. But after that he went to get firewood. And he brought a great deal out near his house. Then he tried to find stones for it. After he had looked about a while, he found a big smooth one. And he put it on a log lying on the ground. And he hunted about for another.

he took both. And he also took both of the big ones. And he put the two small ones into his armpits. And he went up to the house with them. And he put them into the house. He had put green stones into his canoe. His father owned those stones. Now he remembered it. And some soft things were also with them. These were (feathers of) the L!ntc!ut.1 So (the stones) were dry (being covered with feathers). And he went down to get them. And he took them out. And he entered the house with them. Then he laid down a small piece of cedar plank for them. And he unfastened the soft things from around them. And after he had finished doing this to the soft stuff, he took the green stones. Then he struck them over the soft things. And sparks fell down from them. And when (the spark) fell upon the soft things, they were kindled. The stones are called 1Alk-l'ak!a. The stones were not hard. Therefore there was fire in them. After they burned, and he had taken away the live embers, he folded (the stones and the feathers) together. And he took these stones and soft things, and put them up., But then he lighted a fire. He carried fire-wood into his house, and piled a lot of wood on the fire. When the fire was burning, he put it (the copper) on it, and placed the stones in front of himself. All that time he did not drink water. And he took a piece of cedar-bark (with which to remove the copper). It was hot. So he took hold of it with the piece of cedar-bark.

Then he cut off one of the fins (from the copper salmon). And he placed it on something near by. He also cut off another one. And it became cool. So he put it into the fire again. And it (the copper) again got hot. Then he put the piece of cedar-bark around it, and took it out of the fire. Then he cut off its tail. And he cut it apart. And he put it here (in the same place). Then he again took it out of the fire. And he cut off one of its (side) fins. And he also cut off the one on the opposite side. All that time he did not sleep. Then he again put it into the fire. When it was hot, he took it out of the fire again. He was very much afraid of having it get cold. Again he heated it. Again he took it out of the fire. But then he cut off its dorsal fin. He also cut off (another back fin). All that time he laid (the fins) close by. And again he put (the copper) into the fire. Again it became warm. When it was warm, he took it out of the fire again. And he cut off the fin that was under its tail. Then he again put it into the fire. He cut off all of its fins. Again it became hot. And he again took it out of the fire. But then he pressed its body. Then it was pressed out a little larger. And when it became cold, he put it into the fire again. When it was warmed, he took it out. Every time it got cold, he put it into the fire. When it became warm, he again took it out of the fire. At that time he began to press it very hard.

Then he again put (the copper) into it. When it became hot, he took it out again. Then he pressed it for a long time. When it was thin, it was very soft. And then he pressed it, although it was cold. And he finished it. And it was evening. When it was evening, he lay down. He placed (the pieces of copper) near where he lay. Then he did not sleep. All that time he was always feeling about with his hands. While he was fumbling about, morning came. When morning came, he put more fire-wood on. Then he put a big (piece of copper) into the fire. Then it became very warm. Then he took it out. Then he cut it apart, and he cut it a second time in the same way. And he had four pieces. Then he pressed the edges of one of these).

But then his father said to his friends, 'Take my child." Taking him up, they put him into his father's house. But they put the coppers into the house first. Then the house was full of people. They were there to ask how he got the coppers. His throat was dry, because he had not drunk fresh water. Then they did not ask him immediately, because his voice had not become clear. Then they put stones into the fire. His father said, "Put two stones into the fire for my child." Although there was a crowd of people there, they did not talk. Then the stones were heated. Then they put water into a basket. It was half full. They they brought out tongs. And then they took up stones with the tongs, and put them into the water. His mother said, "Put grease into it." So one brought out a small grease-tray. And they poured grease into the basket. And they set it in front of him. Then they gave him a spoon. And they were still in the house. While they were all astonished, he drank this. It was slightly warm. They thought that he would die if they gave him food, so they made him drink warm water. The water was mixed with grease.

Then it again came out of his mouth. Then it was all thrown up. Then, after they had taken the basin from him, he sat down. His father's younger brother sat here (near him). This one was named Great-Thunder. Then his father's brother questioned him. He said to him, "Where have you been, my child?" No one spoke, because they wanted to hear what he said. "I was upon Ekwa'gadAns. I went up in the bed of Mossy Stream. And I ate medicine there. After I had eaten and evening had come, I lay down. Next day I again ate medicine. At that time I did not sleep. When the next evening came, I lay down. And in the middle of the night, I heard something moving below me. Then I went down to the water. And I held my hands ready for it. While I was doing so, I tried to catch it when it moved. And I did not catch it. And I lay down. After I had lain for a while, I heard it move again. And again I went down to it. I sat in the water. Then I again held my hands for it in the water. And when it came inside of my hands, I threw it towards the shore where I had been lying. ."Next day I put my marten-skin blankets around it, and I went down with it. And I came down below. There I built a house. In this I pressed it. I made a fire in it. I put it into the fire. And I pressed it. I pressed it there for two days. When it was finished, I put it into the canoe. Then I came hither with it. Then I passed in front of Swampy Village. Perhaps they did not see me," he said.

time, when people were living at Qa'dji-Lan,l a certain unmarried woman lived there. And they went to get fire-wood. When they came back from getting the fire-wood, a big worm was in it. Then this woman took the worm from the wood and began to suckle it. She suckled it night and day. She always kept it hidden. And when it became large, there was no way to keep it hidden. Then she separated the floor-planks, and dug a hole for it. And she used to nurse it there. In the morning she lay upon her breast upon the floorplanks. Then she let it suck. And next morning she again lay there on her breast. All that time she sang cradle-songs for it: "A man, a man grown, a man, a man grown, my child.

After she had reached maturity, they wanted to marry her, and her parents were unwilling. By and by, after they had asked for her for some time, she disappeared. Then her parents hunted for her. And they saw her footprints going under a steep place near the town. Then they went about there crying. And they came back. But they did not find her. And at the end of three days they saw an old man coming in front of the house with her. And the old man married her. His name was SkA'ldjisan. Therefore this young woman became old from him. -He it was who came to bring food of all kinds to his fatherin-law from a distance. Then the young woman said to her father, "He is always going to do so." And when some time had passed after they went away, he brought food to his fatherin-law again. He brought him many different kinds of food.. After he had remained with them for a while, he started away from them. A long time afterward he again came to them.

low-tide beach to shoot. And he came to a big pond on the beach. And going along by the side of it, he came to where a heron sat. And the heron was not afraid of him. While it sat there, he stood by. He did not want to shoot it. It did not care to fly. Then he wanted to see why it did not fly. And he hunted around it. Then he saw that one-half of its bill was broken. And he caught it. It did not fly from him. And he mended its bill. And since one bill was short, he cut the other of the same length. And he sharpened its bill. And when he had sharpened its bill, he set it at a distance from himself. And it flew away. As it flew, it called much, "Xa xa xa xa xa." It called because it was glad to have its bill sharpened. And after he had shot other small birds, and it was evening, he came home. And when his grandmother had prepared them for eating, she steamed them. And after they had eaten, they slept. And the boy became larger. (One time), before morning dawned, he was asleep. While it was still dark, he got up. And he went out shooting. He went to a long, narrow point whither he had been in the habit of going. Very early he went shooting upon it. Then he found a salmon, half of which had been eaten. This was the first time they had fish to eat. And since he was glad of it, he ran quickly into the house to tell his grandmother. And when he had thrown aside the thing that hung in the doorway, he said to his grandmother, "I have found half of a salmon, grandmother." Then his

grandmother was very glad. And the boy put fire-wood into the fire. He also put stones into it. Meanwhile his grandmother cut up the salmon. When the stones had become hot, she put fresh water into a basket. She also put the salmon into it. The salmon was cooked quickly, because the stones were very hot. A nd when it was cooked, she put it into something, and ate it with her grandson. And in the evening they again went to sleep. And in the morning, while it was still dark, he went out to (the same place) and found a whole salmon there. And he went to his grandmother with it again. He ran because he was very glad. And when he came to the house, even from the outside he called to his grandmother. He said to his grandmother, "Grandmother, I found a whole one." And his grandmother was very glad. Because he sharpened the heron's beak, it did something for him. Something was given to him through the thought of the heron. And when he entered the house, his grandmother again steamed half of the salmon. And she also kept half [for them]. And in the evening they went to sleep. Very early he went out again. All that time he held a bow in his hands, because he thought he would find something. So he did find another big spring salmon. And while he was out there before he breakfasted, his grandmother steamed part of the (first) salmon for him. And he was very glad, so he ran into the house with the big salmon. And he got home with it. The boy said to his grandmother, "Grandmother, I have found a big one. It lies outside."

Then he entered the house, and ate what his grandmother had steamed for him. When he got through eating, and was still surprised (at what he had found), he went for fire-wood. Meanwhile his grandmother cut the big salmon open. And in the evening they again went to bed. And at daybreak he went out again, because he thought he would find something more. Then he also found half of a porpoise lying there. And he took it and carried it into the house. He said to his grandmother, "Grandmother, I have found half of a porpoise." Since his grandmother was very glad, she went out to see it. And they also steamed enough of this to eat. This was half of a big porpoise. And in the evening they again went to sleep. Then her grandson had become very large. And next day he went out again very early. And he found a whole porpoise. And he carried it (home) upon his shoulder and threw it down in front of the house. "What are you doing, grandchild?" said his grandmother to him., "I threw down a whole porpoise," said he to his grandmother. And he went to get fire-wood. And they steamed it. They stopped eating shell-fish. They began to eat only meat and salmon. And again evening came upon them. And her grandchild did not sleep. He always thought, "I will go out very early." Very early next day he went out. And he found half of a whale's jaw near by. And he cut it in pieces. And he brought it up. And when he had gotten through, he again ate.

And he cut them up. And he also brought these up. And he again ate the things his grandmother steamed for him. And while it was still light, he went to get firewood. All that time his grahdmother steamed the food without using an iron kettle. So they only steamed things by means of stones. And it was again evening. Next day he again got up very early. And he went out there again. Then he came to half of a whale lying there. And he cut it up. And when he had it cut up, he brought it up to the house again. After he had brought half of it up, evening came. And he brought it up above the mark of the sea-water. And after he had become tired, he entered the house. And he ate things his grandmother cooked. Then he soon went to sleep, because he wanted to bring the whale (up) very early. So when morning came, very early, while it was still dark, he rose to bring up the whale. And as soon as he had gone down to it, he began to bring it up. And he had brought it all up by noon. And he soon entered the house. And he ate. His grandmother steamed something for him.

mother, "Steam the whale. Only take the grease from it. Put only grease into the empty boxes. But do not cook part of it. I have found another. I am going to cut that up also," said he to his grandmother. And he cut it up all of that day. And late in the evening he had it all cut up. And he left it right there. Then, when he went home and had entered the house, he said to his grandmother, "I have cut it all up, grandmother. Give me food quickly. I am very tired. I will go to bed at once. While it is still dark, I will again go out to work." And he arose while it was dark. And he kindled a fire. And after he had eaten, he went out (to it) again. And he again began to bring the whale up to the house. And he knew he would bring all up in one day. And he brought all up that day. Because something hejped him, although it was heavy, it was easy for him. He finished it all that evening. And when he went home and had entered the house, (he said to his grandmother,) "Give me food quickly, grandmother. I am going to sleep quickly. I am very tired." And before he went to bed, he said to his grandmother, "When our friends turned us out, we ate nothing but things found at low tide. Now, although I am tired, I am getting more. The whale is too much for us. And we have not boxes into which to put the quantity of grease. I will not get up very early," he said to his grandmother. And so he slept for a long time in tne morning. But his grandmother got up very early and made a fire. And she cooked food for him. And present90-JESUP NORTH PACIFIC EXPED., VOL. X.

ly, when he was tired of sleeping, he awoke. "Get up, grandchild, and eat your food while it is still warm,' said his grandnmother to him. And he arose quickly. And he went outside. But he did not go down to the beach. He re-entered (the house). And when he entered the house, his grandmother set food in front of him. And he ate. Then he got through eating, and thought, "Suppose I go down to the beach again." And he went down. And when he went down, he saw another big whale- lying there. And he went to it. And when he had walked around it, (he said,) "I will not cut this up. I will leave it there." And he walked up to his grandmother, and said to his grandmother, "I have found another whale on the beach. I will not cut it up. But I will get fire-wood to-day for you." And all that day he brought in fire-wood for her. And at noon two girls came to him. These were the two daughters of his youngest uncle. They had food in their hands. They came to his grandmother. And she told them to come into the house. They had made their house larger. And when her grandson brought in fire-wood, his grandmother said to him, "Stop for a while, grandchild. Your uncle's two children have come." And he went in. "Have you given them food?" said he to his grandmother. "No, grandchild, they have just come, said his grandmother to him. "Give them food," said he to his grandmother. These young women

They went home without having given their food to their grandmother, because they were ashamed of what they had in their hands, since (the others) had so much. They kept part of the whale that was given them to show to their parents. When it was nearly evening, they came to the town. And they entered their house. And as they came in, their mother questioned them. " Where have you been?" she said. "We went to see where grandmother and the boy live," said these young women to their mother. "Have you seen them?" their mother said to them. And they told their mother that they had. "We saw them," said these young women to their mother. "Are they still alive?" said their mother to them. "Why! mother, the house of those you turned out is full of whale. Outside there is also an abundance of whale. In front of them a whole one is also lying. And their boxes are also all full of grease." Thus they reported to their mother. Their mother said that they were telling a lie. Their father also said the same thing. "Perhaps you are telling a lie," they said to their children. All that time they had the small pieces concealed in their hands. Then they showed the whale. They showed it to their mother. "We took along part of the food you gave us this morning in our hands. When we came to them, we were ashamed to give it to them. And we brought it back." Thus they

(The boy and his grandmother) were not far from the town. And when (the people) came to them, they told them to come into the house quickly. (The people) saw their whale lying upon the beach. They saw their (whale) outside, and in the house. They saw that (the house) was full of boxes. (The boy) told them to sit down. These two people were their own friends. And they gave them food. Then they (the two people) spoke to them as follows: "Two women came from you. And (the people) said (the two women) lied. Therefore we came to see you. Now we are very glad to have seen you. All the people will come quickly from the town to you. We are also very glad to see your whales. When the two women came yesterday and told about you, they were very glad. Now we, too, see you. So they will be very glad on account of what we have seen." Thus they spoke to them. When they were ready to go home, the boy gave them some whale. And they carried it home on their backs. And they reached the town just at noon. Then (the people) saw (the two persons) bring in the whale on their backs. Now they knew it was true.

Then they were very glad. And when (the messengers) took the whale into the house, they told their wives to cut it up quickly. While their wives cut it up, they put stones into the fire. And they heated them. The stones were hot, and one of these women owned two baskets in which to steam things. One was fair-sized, and one was big. And she gave one of these to the other woman. And when the stones were heated, both of them put fresh water and whale into the baskets. Their husbands having put stones into them, they turned the stones over and over, because they feared the baskets would burn. Then (the water) boiled very much. When (the food) was cooked, they stopped putting in stones. And when (the water) stopped boiling, they skimmed off the grease and whalemeat. And they dipped (the food) out into something. And they began to put this into many trays. And they counted the trays. Then they began to give to the house-chiefs. They gave food to all in the town. Then they held a council. "The whole town shall go to them, (WI'txao and her grandson)," they said. (The town-people) were very glad, because they were very hungry. At that time there was no food to be seen. And when they were about to start out, this young man's uncles' wives dressed up all their daughters. But the two that saw them did not prepare themselves. The young man's youngest uncle's children were two, of whom the younger had been kind to him. He always remembered it. She was kind to him from the time when she was very smnall.

And they started out. And when they got near (the boy's house), his eldest uncles vied with one another to come in in front of him, because they wanted him to marry their daughters. Because they wanted him to marry their daughters, they dressed them up. But his youngest uncle, the father of the one who had taken pity on him, came far behind them. There was a long, level beach in front of the place where he lived. And all landed in front of him. And his youngest uncle came after them. And when they landed in a good place, he merely looked at them. There was a great crowd of people. This was the whole of a very big town. And the youngest was still in his canoe. (The young mnan) went to his uncle. He said to him (and his daughter,) "You, indeed, come in and stay with us." So they went into the house with them. Just as they landed, one went to him, and said to him, "Your uncles want you to marry their daughters very much. Therefore they dressed up their daughters. Therefore they have contested with one another to come in front of you." So he spoke to him. Just after he (the young man) heard this, his youngest uncle arrived, and he went down quickly. And as soon as they entered the house, he said to his uncle, "Let me marry your younger daughter, for she was kind to me while she was young." And his uncle was very glad of it. The wife was also very glad. And she told her daughter to sit near him. "Sit near your father's nephew, my child," said her mother to her. And her daughter also sat near

But the rest of his uncles were very sad, because they had dressed up their daughters expecting he would marry them, but yet he had married the youngest's daughter. Therefore they were very sad.' And he gave his uncle food. He was in great haste, for he wanted to give food to his uncles and to all the other people. And after he had given food to his uncle, he said to his wife, 'I am going to give the one that lies on the beach to every one. Tell your father to go down also. I am not going to give very much to your father, because there is very much outside. If there is not enough, I will give as well some of that just outside." So he spoke to his uncle before he went. Then he went out to his (other) uncles. And he went into all the houses in the town. "All of you men go to the whale and cut it up," he said to all in the town. Then they went quickly to the whale. And they all got there. And he said to them, "Let each one take so much. You take this. You take this." Thus he spoke to all in the town. Part of them stood on one side. Part of them stood on the other side. And there was enough whale for every one. They were going to pay him, so he gave to all.

They took every part of it. And they went to eat. And he said to them, "After you have eaten, let all go up to my house. I will give you another whale. It is in front of the place where I live."

And next day the eldest of his fathersin-law came in to his younger brother. He was a great chief. And when he saw the property, he said to his sonin-law, "The property is too much. Potlatch very soon." And he agreed. "Good, I will potlatch at- once. I will speak to you to-morrow. I shall call you to work cedar for me," said he to him. And next day he spoke to them. And all went to get the cedar. And in the evening they came back. They did not bring back the cedar. They left it there.

People fought at the town' of Git!e'ks. They destroyed the town of Git!e'ks. One woman (with her mother) was saved. She was menstruant for the first time. She was in an empty cellar. Her mother was thinking. Then she found out what to do. She thought like this. "I will travel on with my child," she thought. So she did travel. From the start she called out, "Who will marry my daughter?" Thus she spoke. Another person answered her. "I "What will marry your daughter." will you do when you marry my daughter?" said this woman. The man answered, "I will pull out a skunk-cabbageroot on the other side of G!'algadAni village." It was Deer that said this. The woman said in reply, "No."

Then she again started on. She went farther. And she again called. "Who will marry my daughter?" she said. This woman's daughter's name was Lia. "I," said Wolf. "When you marry Lia, what will you do?" said the woman. "Can I not growl at the enemies opposite?" said Wolf. "No," answered the woman.

Then she again started on. Before she had walked far, she called again. "Who will marry my daughter Lia?" she said. "I," answered Marten. "What can you do?" said Lia's mother. "Can I not show my teeth at the enemies opposite?" he said. "No," said the woman, Lia's mother.

She started on again. Before she had walked far, she called again. "Who will marry my daughter Lia?" she said. "Shall not I?" said Eagle.

the small bird named Djidja't said. Then the woman said in reply, "When you marry my daughter Lia, what will you do?" Thus Lia's mother asked him. " Can I not call out at the enemies opposite?" answered Djidja't. "No," answered the woman.

Then she went on again. Before she had gone far, she called again. "Who will marry my daughter?" called the wornan, Lia's mother, still more. "Shall not I?" said another small bird. He could do nothing. "When you marry my daughter, what will you do?" said Lia's miother. The woman's mother's mind was very sick. When she first set out, powerful animals wanted to marry her daughter. " But now a weak bird makes fun of my daughter by speaking of marrying her. Therefore I am very sick in mind." So she said within her mind, because all of her uncles had been destroyed -at Git!eks. Because they destroyed her uncles, she wished her daughter to marry a strong person. But now a strong man had not married her. Then she wept still more, because she was low in mind. Her mind had become very low. After her mind had been low, her mind became stronger. She wiped away her tears with tlhe thing she wore on her back (her blaniket or shawl). At that time she opened her eyes. And she saw things. But before that, she saw nothing on account of the tears that covered her eves. Then she started oIn again. Then she did not call quickly. She looked

and cooked it. And she ate it. Her heart became stronger. Regularly every day, different kinds of food lay in front of her house. She was a long time in that country. Her mind was not troubled at staying there. She thought she would see her child again. But her mind, which before was weak, now became strong. Then she heard the sound of a voice from above. She looked up. And she saw a basket already coming down. This woman saw young boys in the basket. Then she rejoiced. "Whose children are you?" said this woman. "We are Lia's children," said the boys. The woman's heart was good. She took one of the small boys. And she held it on her knee. She did the same to all. She counted. And there were nine males. There was also one girl. With that one there were ten.

The youngest had a bow. He also had two arrows. The points represented weasels. Then the woman looked upon the faces of the boys. And she saw that they were painted. She saw that half of their faces were red. And the upper part was painted to represent a net. Then she questioned them about their mother. "Where is your mother?" Thus she questioned them. Then the short men answered, telling their grandmother where their mother was. "Above," said the boys to their grandmother in reply.
After they had said this, the children saw the basket shaking. They made

She heard

a

voice from

above saying, "You will stay here." She heard the voice up in the air. "You will stay forever in one of these trees, was said to the mother-in-law of Lia's husband. This was the last the woman saw of her grandchildren. She became as if dead. Then the basket went up from her. She was going to live forever in one tree.' After many years had passed over, the basket was again coming down. Then the children had become stronger. They stood below. Then the basket went up again empty. At that time it became colder. They started off. At that time the ground was also dry. The wind also breathed. Trees creaked against one another. And Lia heard At a sound as if one were calling. that time Lla was with all of her children. L-a knew that her mother had become a tree. Her son-in-law put her into the tree. Therefore Lla knew it. And she told her children. It is my mother who is talking." Thus she spoke to her children.

They looked about in the places where all of the houses had been burned. Then they picked up sticks. They also collected logs. When they had (collected) plenty, they made a house. It was completed. At that time it became cold. It was winter. Then they bathed in the sea for strength, as they used to do in old times. While they were doing so, it became very much colder. The ice became thick in front of the town where they lived. All of them went into the sea-water. All nine went into the seawater.

They prepared the things in which they were going to fight (i. e., their armor). Then their things were ready. They awaited the day expectantly. Not one knew the day for thinking of it, for they thought they would destroy them quickly.' Therefore, until the day came, they were very happy. Then they saw that the (number of) days was completed. Then they saw that it was a very fine day. Besides, it was cold. At that time it was about the middle of winter. Then they saw them standing upon the ice. This was the first time some of them had seen them. And they saw that they were not wearing such things as human beings wear. They saw that half of their faces were red. Above that, they saw designs like nets. But then they were astonished. Some were also very happy. At that time they stood in the very middle of the ice. This crowd of people also went to them. And they stood opposite them. At that time they were standing without fighting. Then they set down the war-spears on both sides, as they used to do, before fighting. Then the fight began. And while they fought, the sun got low. Then Lia's children became tired. la, however, did not fight. She only told her children what to do. So they did not kill even one of her children.

One knew well how to fight. That one owned a bow. He also owned two arrows with weasels on both points. So, when he shot those whom they were fighting against, the (weasels) bit through their throats. His arrows came back to him. And he shot another. They were unable to kill off the people with whom they fought, because they were many, for there were four successive towns belonging to those they fought against. Then they became tired. Those they were fighting were also tired.

Then neither side was able to stop fighting, for if either fled, they would be destroyed. Now they were going to find what Lia's husband said to his mother-in-law. When the time was up, night fell. Then the sunshine could not be seen from above, Still the sunshine began to strike down from above. But there was no sunshine where Lia's children stood. But the sunshine fell on the side of those they were fighting against. Then it struck on the ice. And the ice split up. All of those that LIa's children fought against were killed. They went down between the (pieces of) ice. This is how what LIa's husband promised to his mother-in-law came about. Before that, when Lla's mother went about calling with L-a, her heart was sick. But now Lia was glad. Then her children destroyed the people of the four towns that stood one behind another. Then they, too, were very glad. Then those people that had laughed at them and their wives wept bitterly, because they knew that they 93-JESUP NORTH PACIFIC EXPED.1 VOL. X.

They did not want to keep them as slaves. They only took some of them for their sisters. And when the rest saw it, they also wept very much. When they heard that, they again had pity. They also gathered those together. Those they freed. Some of their children were boys. Some of their children were girls. Then their children grew up.

And from outside they heard (the chief) question him. And the young man answered, "More water stands in it. Therefore I ran to you with the news, because I knew your mind would be glad." And the chief said to him, "Go out and call loudly. Say that it is not well for a single young woman to go out." Thus the chief spoke to the youth. At that time they tabooed things. Therefore the chief was much disturbed, for he thought if a young woman saw it, the water would dry up. When he was through speaking, all knew. And they kept their children indoors. Not even one of their daughters went out. They did as the chief said. As they had honored Lia's children, so they honored this (chief). When he learned that what he said would be obeyed, he was very glad.

Then he remembered a being that used to be called Lord-of-the-Days.' And he said, Lord-of-the-Days, give me much water, so that all of my own people may live." And he prayed for this water to the being they called Lord-of-the-Days. He prayed so, because he knew Lia's children to be the children of Lord-of-the-Days. Then it was dark.

Then he called loudly to his wife. All the people in the house also awoke. "What is it?" his wife asked of him. "Just in the middle of the town, very much water is flowing down," said he to his wife. All the people in the house also heard it. Then they also heard the cries. They went outside together. At that time it became very light. Then they saw that the house in the middle of the town had been swept away. They heard those people crying there. Then the chief's wife was very angry with her husband. "Why do you pray so much to Lord-of-the-Days? For that, your town-people are destroyed," said his wife to him. At that time the woman's mind was very sad because he had prayed for water. "Do not say (pray) any more that way. Only use the paintings of Lia's children, and they will make you win." Thus his wife spoke to him. He also answered his wife. "Good, I will do so." Thus the husband said to his wife. While he was speaking thus with his wife, they saw a very deep stream cutting through the earth. Still all of the town was not swept away.

Then he again got food for them. And when they were through eating, they questioned him. "Chief, will it not be well to name the water?" This is what they asked him. When he heard this, his mind was very good. Then the chief answered, 'Come, let us name it." Thus he spoke to them. And they thought over it for a while. Then they asked one another, "How shall we name it?" Thus they questioned one another. And they thought a while over its name. One said, "We made it like a salmon-trap river." Thus he spoke. Another also spoke. "Call it Salmon-Trap," he said. Then the chief agreed. And the chief said, "People shall call us Salmon-TrapPeople."' Then all of the people of the town agreed. They also said, "The last generation of people shall know the name of this town." Thus all said together. Another also spoke. "This name, along with the paintings of LIa's childeren, shall not be destroyed," they said. Then all agreed. Then their town became better. Now people still see the place where the river used to run. They still call it by the same name. The end of the story.

XA'na went up upon ga'lgAm " because he wanted to be a chief. He went up upon it to eat medicine. And when he got up there, he made a small house for himself. After he had completed it, he began to put medicine into it. When he had gotten through putting the medicine in, he began to eat. The fire was in front of him. And he took grease with him in a big stomach. Before he ate the medicine, he drank a little grease. If one did not drink grease first, the medicine acted badly inside of him, and he died. He did this, because he was afraid of dying. He was eating xela'oga.3 In the evening he went to sleep, and did the same thing next day. But he did not eat medicine at night. Next day he did the same thing. All that time he took grease. And when night came on, he did not eat. And he went to sleep. And next day very early he ate again. He did this for eight days. And he became lean. The medicine made him want to vomit. Then he went down. And he sat above And while he sat a very steep place. there, night came upon him.

And (War-Talker) had his son live at Swampy-Village.4 He did not want to live in the same town with his son, because his son was a chief's son.5 Meanwhile HangingShining went to get mussels to take the juice out of cedar-roots. Her husband's slave went with her. There was sea-water inside of the place where they went to get mussels. And they laid something across, and walked out upon it. After they had used this for some time, Hanging-Shining fell off of it into the water. And her slave could not get out to her. And she was drowned. Her slave went and told about it. Then they went down to get her. And they bore her away. And they put her into the house. And they had her sit up. And they also had her slave hold her up. They had her hold her up for four days.

Next day he came back again. And they had brought up silver salmon just before his arrival. And one of the cords for tying together the silver salmon broke. Just as it gave way, he came there. This was a twisted cedarbough. Then, while they were talking about the giving-way of the string of the silver salmon, he remained below. Then he spoke. "Ha ha-o, Devil'sClub remains below while people talk about the silver-salmon-string," he said. And he went away from the beach. Afterwards he lived there for a long time. Then Skl'laowE's slave found a whole tree of pitch-wood. And he left it. When his slave found the pitchwood, he (Ski'laowe) was starting off. He told his slave to split the pitchwood up. And they lighted it. And when they started off, he stood beside the pitch. And while it was burning, they came to White-Slope (Masset). And when he got off of his canoe, he had on his dance-hat. And the pitch-wood was beside him. While he still stood on the beach, his slaves built a house, because he did not want to stay there without walls. But when the sides were raised, he entered. At that time he was going to build Star-House. Then he began to build Star-House. And after they had worked upon it for a while, he finished it. The entire house-front was full of holes. So he called it StarHouse.' And after he had lived at White-Slope for a while, he went to live at Salmon-Berry-Bushes.2 And

And they could not see where to go. And they tied their canoe to some kelp. And they were a long time upon the water. And days went by. And they put blankets around their faces. Although they were very near the town, they could not see the town, because they had made something angry with them by breaking its wing. Therefore it became foggy. " Your grandfather asks you to come in, said some one to them. Then they looked to see him, and did not see him. He spoke to them this way for a long time. And they tried to find out secretly. And they looked out through the eye-holes of the marten-skins they wore as blankets. Then they found out that it was a sculpin. And they went down into the water after it. And as they went down into the water, they descended upon a slanting trail. And they came and stood in front of a big house. And the people took them into the house. And they told them to go to the rear of the house, and they sat there. This was Killer-Whale's house. And before they had staid there for a long time, they got ready to put fins on them. And they brought out killer-whales' dorsal fins. And they threw the long one at the back of the elder. And the younger put upon his back a whetstone he had hanging down in front of him.

And he again went out from his parents, weeping because his parents did not know him. And the rain fell very hard. Then he sat in the gutter (where the rain drops from the roof). And he let it drop upon the top of his head. And he sat there for a long time. Then the rain opened a hole just at the top of his head. And a killer-whale-skin was washed off from him. And when he felt the killer-whaleskin washed off from his entire body, he stood up. And he started away.

Then he again went in to his parents. But this time they saw him. Then they knew it was their son. And his parents were very glad. And when he slept, he made a noise like a killerwhale. And he related how he had been taken into a Killer-Whale's house. But he said that his elder brother was kept in the house forever. "They put his dorsal fin upon him," he said. "But they were unsuccessful with mine, because I put upon my back the whetstone I had slung in front. And when they were unsuccessful with mine, they sent me back. So I came back to you," he said. He said to his mother, "Mother, put a mat around me. My elder brother wants to go hunting with me." And she put the mat around him. And she also put on his cape. And she put his hat on him. And he always hunted with his elder brother during the night. And next day he sat in the house in the morning. And all the things he wore were wet. "Mother, take these from me," he said. So his mother took them from him. And she hung his things up. And as he sat near the fire, he said to his mother, "He threw up over there for you the thing he shot." And his parents went to look. And they saw a black whale lying there. Then they cut up the black whale and took it to their house. And after many more days were passed, he said that his elder brother had called to him. "Mother, dress me up again. Put my mat around me. Put my cape on me," said he. "Also put my hat on my head," he said. And although he sat in the house

during the night, he (yet) hunted about with his elder brother. And when day broke again, they returned. And they again threw something up where they had thrown it up before. And next day he again said to his mother, "Mother, take the mat from me again. Also take the cape from me." And she took them from him. And she took the hat from him also. And he again sat beside the fire. Then his parents went to see the thing that his elder brother had thrown up. And they saw it was another black whale. And after they had cut it all up, they brought it to the house. They brought it all up. All that time she cooked it. And for many nights afterwards he did not go hunting with his elder brother. And when he slept, he made a noise like a killer-whale. One evening he again told his mother to dress him. "Mother, put my mat around me. Also put my cloak around me. Also put my hat on my head." And he sat in the house. And he went hunting for things with his elder brother. And when day came, he returned. This time he wept bitterly. And his parents heard his voice. And he said to his mother, "Mother, take my mat from me, my cloak, and my hat. My elder brother has been killed at Cape St. James.' I came home with my elder brother's dead bddy. I put my elder brother's dead body on a sandy place below." And his parents went to look. And a killer-whale lay there. And they cut it up. And they took it up to the house. They put it close

There was a town in L!'elAni Inlet.' It was named Tobacco-Drying-Town. This was a big town. There were very many, chiefs. One was named Xi'nao. He was chief of the town. Before that, they did not own the grisly bear (as a crest). And Xi'nao went to the Kitkatla people.2 And when he came to the town, he went to the town-chief, whose name was Tc!e'basa. He was with him many days. And Tc!ebasa questioned Xi'nao. ." What did you have in mind that made you want to come to see me?" said he to him. And X(i'nao replied, 'I wanted to see you to get a crest." At the same time a man of the Ski'daoqao 3 also came to him (Tc!e'basa). And he also questioned the Ski'daoqao man. "aXA'na, what did you want when you came to see me?" And XA'na also (said), 'I came to see you because I wanted a crest." And Tc!e'basa replied, "I have not many crests. I own only the grisly bear, the mountaingoat-head and the moon-doorway." And both of them wanted only the grisly bear. And he gave the grisly

And there were also weasels upon his war-coat. And he gave only the grisly bear to XA'na. But he also gave him the moon-doorway. He came to own it. So the Li'elAni-Point-Town-People came to own the grisly bear, Ski'daoqao as well, and (the latter) the representation of the moon. So Ski'daoqao's house is called Moon-House. And he returned to EL'elAni with the crests. And after his people had lived for a while at LI'elAfi, they went to Rose Spit. And they made a town at People's-Town. They came to live among the StA'stas.1 And they used to make war upon the Tsimshian. They went to war in Nass Inlet. And they had very many people as slaves.2

How the Dog-Fish Crest originated.
A woman went travelling with her husband. She used to make fun of the dog-fish. They went to visit a small rock in the sea. When they were out there, the dog-fish, whose home the rock was, came and took the woman down into the sea. There she discovered that the dog-fish were really people. They had taken off their dog-fish blankets. After she had staid in the house for some time, fins began to grow upon her arms, her legs, and her back. Her husband was searching for her everywhere,, but he was not able to find her. After a number of years he found her. Her face had remained unchanged; bu't fins had grown on her arms, on her legs, on her back, and on her head. She never returned. Ever since that time her family (the Yaku la'nas) have used the dog-fish crest, and their house is called Dog-Fish House (Q!at-nas).3
leading Eagle family on the northwestern coast of Graham Island. They owned Kiusta. Their wars with the Tsimshian and Nass peopre are told in the Skidegate texts (Bulletin 29, Bureau of American Ethnology, pp. 393-400). 3 Probably this refers to the one division of the Yaku la'nas, or Middle-Town-People, who were so called.

After he had lived there for a long time, Ek!u'kAsLas wanted to gamble with HIai'yas. And he gambled with him. And only Lk!u'kAsLas won. He won all of (Haiyas') things from him. And Hai'yas always wore a knife hung in front of him with which to kill people. And although he was very fond of his knife, he wagered it with him. And it was lost. And he refused to give it to him. "Let us stop," said Hai'yas. And Lk!t'kAsLas said, "Good." That was the only word he uttered, because he was very glad of having won many things. So he did not care for the knife. And when it was calm, Lk!UI'kAsLas set out to return to his friends, and he came to them. A great crowd of his friends were in the house with him. "Have you any news?" they said to him. "No," said he. And after that he told the following news. "I won everything from Hai'yas. But he would not give me the war-knife that I won," he said. And his friends began to talk about it. And they said, "What shall we do to him?" They were very sad on account of it. He was a great chief, so Ek!u'kAsLas only said, "I want to make a likeness of him on a big gambling-stick I own." And the friends of Ek!fi'kAsLas all said, "Good." And he began to make it. And he

They said to him, "Lk!u'kAsLas has burned a likeness of you upon a gambling-stick. He named it after you, for he was very sad on account of the war-knife." Hai'yas said, "Bring hither my friends the chiefs, with the young men and the women, so that we can talk the thing over." And all entered his house, and began to talk it over.

And the greasebox was named The Sea. And he again called all his friends, the chiefs. And all went into the house. He said to them, "I called you to tell you how many coppers I am going to throw away on account of him. I am going to throw away ten coppers, for he has acted as if he had killed me," said he to his friends. And all his friends, the chiefs, said "Good." And they started away from him.

Before he lifted its tail, he made a noise like an eagle. Then he lifted its tail again. And again it came down in abundance. And he called again. Then he again raised its tail. And wool again came down from under its tail in abundance. And they were looking at Hai'yas' coppers. After (Lk!i'kAsLas) had done so a long time, his (wool) was all gone. Ek!U'kAsLas sat inside of the eagle. When he stopped, (the visitors) started off with Hai'yas. And he did not use the things lent him by Restinghis-Breast-on-a-Town.

And they had only big halibut bite. When their canoe was full, they started home. The fishing-bank was called YudA'lgAns because the halibut were large. Then the sea-water was not far out from the town. And as soon as their wives had taken out the entrails, the husbands carried the halibut up to the houses. Two grown men carried up each of the halibut because they were big. They did this for a long time. They did so as long as they lived in the town. And sometimes the wind blew strong

They also took ten extra paddles. And they at once lay down in the canoe. And they let themselves drift off. And when they were abreast of Ya'gAn-Point,' all got up. And they began to go to land against the strong wind. And they came in. And they took the canoe up. And they went into the houses. They did not do this way always. They only did so when the wind blew hard. And when it was very calm, they would go hunting for sea-otter. And they shot many. And when they killed females with young, they did not kill the young ones. And they took them in. They did so in all the canoes. And when they came home, they gave them (the young sea-otter) to their children to play with. The tide used to come up to the place where a little house stands. It was only dry when the tide was low. And when the tide was low, the children went to the saltwater pond. And they played with the sea-otter pups in the lake. And while it was calm, they hunted seaotters. And they again took young ones alive for their children. Sometimes, too, they made war. A woman also used to go along with her brothers. Her name was Qa'Lga.

Drink. There was a well in his house. And all the people of the town took water from it. He was first named WI'a. And his house was named Remembered-House. And CopperPillow's house was named WhaleHouse. And the front of his house was painted to represent a whale. So it was named Whale-House. And upon the corner-posts of Hai'yas' house sat two persons pointing their fingers towards each other. And his house was named Pointing-House. And the people of the town owned the whole whale. And when a whale was washed up, the people of the town cut off its tail. And they carried it up. And they laid it in front of Hai'yas' house. They did this when they were reckless of their strength. And the chief of Those-born-at-LI'elAni owned the shoulder. And then the townpeople used to get the body. And when the wind again blew hard from the southeast, they again launched a canoe. Only strong people went. There were ten in the canoe. And there were also ten paddles. And they also took in ten extra ones besides. And again they lay down in the canoe. And they again drifted seaward. And when they got even with the rocky point, they rose. And they went towards land. And they were unable to get in. They began to break their paddles. And they untied those that were in the canoe. And they broke all of the paddles. They played with the wind because they were proud of their strength. And when they had broken all of their paddles, they began to drift out

sideways. And although there were very many people, they were afraid to go out after them in canoes because the wind blew hard. The people of the town wept bitterly. And they drifted out of sight. And whenever it was calm, the people hunted sea-otter. They also fished. And they again kept the (young) sea-otters alive for their children. And a shaman at the town named Djatqonsi'n prophesied some misfortune. "The whole town is going to be destroyed, because the children laugh at the young sea-otter when they play with them, said he to them. This person was a great shaman. And presently, when it was a calm morning, the whole town went hunting. Part of them also went fishing. And while they were engaged thus, the wind began to blow hard. The rollers also made a noise like thunder. And before they went hunting, the shaman said to his wife, "When I am lost with them, and you come to look for me, do not let the child come with you. I am going to come back from death," he said. So, the day after they were lost, she hunted for her husband. Her child was then menstruant for the first time. And she also went with her mother, who came to her husband lying upon the sand. And she quickly made her husband sit up. And her daughter came to her quickly. And when she wanted to hold him at one side, she could not. He (fell back and) died forever because his daughter saw him in the unlucky period. And they did not find one of the (other) people of the town.

The Rear-Town-People 2 and Thoseborn-at-House-Point 7 lived at HousePoint (Rose Spit). And the men of all the people of this town built small houses at the Point. And the tops of the houses had holes in them large enough for their hands. And they also grassed over the roofs. And in the morning, after all had eaten, they went thither. And they all entered the houses and sat down. And after they had been there for a while, an eagle perched upon the house of a certain person. Then he seized it through the hole, and he broke both of its wings. He also broke one of its legs. And he let it go upon the house. And when the eagle went out, it walked about near the small house.

I have accepted the interpretation which agrees with that given to me at Skidegate. 2 See the note above. My interpreter gave, "Those-born-at-House-Point."

And next day he went there again. And he demanded it. And they would not give it back to him. And in the evening he started away. Then he ate. And he went to bed. And next day he. again went there. And again he demanded it. When he demanded it, his friends watched him, because their minds were sad on account of the hawk. Then they were again unwilling to give it to him. At noon they began to fight on account of it. The Rear-Town-People and Those-born-at-House-Point began to fight with each other. The RearTown-People took the hawk away from Those born at House- Point, for the Rear-Town-People were great fighters. They were also numerous. Then they began to grow angry with each other. But no one was killed. After this anger had continued for some time, Those-born-at-House-Point went away. And they went to People'sTown. And the Rear-Town-People also went away. They were also going to cease to live at House-Point (Rose Spit). And they came to live at White-Slope (Masset). Those-bornat-House-Point continued to have their town at People's-Town. And the RearTown-People lived here (at Masset) with the Eggs- of- Sk2dao. Many families lived at White-Slope. And the Rear-Town-People began fighting with the Eggs-of-Skl'dao.' Then

they began to kill one another. A man of the Eggs-of-Ski'dao was killed, and a man of the Rear-Town-People was also killed. And the Rear-TownPeople left Masset also. The RearTown-People ceased to live at Masset. They had a fort upon Ma'sit Island' for a short time. And after that they also came to live at 'ai'in River.2 After that they also came to live at Yan.3 A small stream named Yan flows down at this town. Therefore the town is called Yan. And the people are also called Yan-People. And Those-born-at-House-Point also went from People's-Town to Skidegate. And after Those-born-at-House-Point had lived at Skidegate for a while, they went to High-Point.4 And they came to live there. They lived there a long time. And the big sand-mountain standing there (Cape Ball) is called Chief. It is also called Mighty-Breakers, also One-into-whose-House-the-Windblows, also Resting-his-Side-on-the-Island. It is also called He-into-whoseHouse-the-Day-breaks, also Great-FoodGiver. It is also called Sand-Chief. And it is also called A'sigwan. Its sister is called Winter-Woman. So Those born at House Point all are named from it. And after they had lived at HighPoint for a while,' they went back to Skidegate. They did not like to live at High-Point. And they came to live at Skidegate for good. Now they still live there. The Rear-Town-People took

And he did not see land. Then evening again came upon him in the fog. All that time the wind was not strong. And morning again came upon him. Then he was floating about near a certain land in the morning. And he continued to float about there. He did not go ashore, because his legs were bent together. So he did not get off. All that time they did not see him. Although people lived very near the place where he was, they did not see him. Then he saw a child which knew how to talk, but was not large, playing about. And the child did not see him, because he was floating against a rock. It did not see him. And tld-ini called to the child, because he wanted them (the people) to know about him. And when he called to it, it was afraid to go to him. And after it had been afraid of him for some time, he said to the child, "I am Pldi'n." This (child) was a boy. And he (the child) went out to him. And he came and stood near him. And he said to him, "My name is Ildi'ni. Now you, too, say 'iRd!'n!,'" said he to him. And the child said "Ildi'ni." But he said it wrong, because he did not know how to talk very well. Then Ildi'ni mentioned his name again, and the child also mentioned his name. Then he said it right. And the child left him. And

And after the water had become a little warm, the woman began putting it upon his legs. At the same time the man also kept warm things upon his head. And sitting up a little, he tried to straighten his legs. And they were well. Then they stopped putting hot water upon them. And when he asked for a stick, they gave it to him. And when they gave it to him, he stood up by means of it. Then he tried to go outside. After he had sat outside for a while, he came back. They saw that he was different (that is, sick), therefore they did not give him fcod. Although they had not seen him before, they perceived that he was a chief. Then they warmed water for him. They cooked food for him besides. After the water was warm, she (the woman) put a great deal of grease into it. And they set it before him. And they also gave him a spoon. This is the way the ancient people did. After he had drunk the broth, (the woman) also put food before him. She also let him eat grease with it. And after he had eaten, she put another kind of food before him. And when she saw that he ate his food in a natural manner, she gave him another kind of food. Then she saw that he had become well.

And they arrived at the town with him. And they (the town-people) were surprised at (the sight of) them. Before, they had had but one canoe. But when (they saw that) they now had two, they were surprised. They awaited them outside in a crowd. Then they saw another person sitting in (one of the canoes). When they came ashore, the whole town went to them, because they had never seen (this person) before. They came to the town of Stikine' with him. And they quickly took them into the house. And the house was full of Stikine people, men, women, and children. They were astonished at him. Although they had not seen him before, they perceived that he was a chief.

When he was well, we came hither with him. I came hither with him because I did not want to stay alone with him in an uninkabited country," he said. While they were telling about him, they saw him feeling of his skin with his teeth. And they told one another about it. Then the chief of the Stikine people said, "Taste the chief's blood." And one felt of his skin with his teeth. And when he lifted his head, he said, "The chief's blood is salt." Then the Stikine people were very much surprised. Then they knew that he had been blown about for a very long time. The town-people went out. Although they knew what had happened to him, they did not know from whence he had come. And they began to take care of him there. Then he was there for many years. And he staid there for good. He did not return because he did not know where his town was. He had four children. Two were boys and two were girls. And all the time he was at Stikine he wept for his children. But he did not weep for his wife. He who found him took him as his friend (clansman). After he had lived there for a long time, he came to understand their language. And after he had wept for a while, he cried and sang.

And his friends the Fish-Eggs lost him. And by and by his friends heard that he was chief of Stikine. In olden times they did not go to all places in canoes. They fastened a feather on the end of a stick. Then they set it upright. If the feather was not moved by the wind, they went out. Therefore they did not learn about him quickly.

the people of Water-Hole-Long-andWide, went to look for spring salmon. And they fastened their canoes to the marked sticks of the people of People'sTown. Then the people of People'sTown came up, and there was no place where they might fasten their canoes. Then they were very angry. This happened every day. One morning the people of Water-Hole-Long-and-Wide and the people of People's-Town fought together, and killed one another, for there was no food to be seen. At that time it was hard to kill salmon. Therefore they fought. And after many had been killed on either side, they both went away. And they made helmets and gorgets. And they also made war-coats. And they also made greaves. And they covered all their bodies. There were only holes just over their eyes. A little of their heels was also in sight.

And when he got very many, he put them into the fire. And he lay down behind them. And when the sparks were about to fall upon him, he got up quickly. And not even one fell upon him.

And when they found animal bones, they also used those for them (their points). They also had spears. They fought with those things. It was hard to kill one another with those things.

And he spoke to all of his friends. "The bow was not strong." Then one handed him a bow and arrows. And he tested it. And it was strong. "Now, chiefs, this is good," he said. "Now, chiefs, point the end of my arrow straight at the place where Da'sqe went up," he said. And they pointed it straight there. And he drew the bow strongly. And he shot. And his arrow went far up.

I came because I wanted to see you, for you called me ki'lsLa-i,l hi hi hi." Thus he sang. He sang four songs. And he danced a great deal at the same time, for he was glad. And when he was through dancing, they again said "Ha ha ha ha" four times.

Afterwards TAldaL!as's friends also danced much in one house. The houses of all the people of the town were full. Anid they gave the Deer back to his friends. And all of Da'sqe's friends also danced. All that time the chiefs talked together. And as they danced, they gave the Deer back to his friends. And the people of WaterHole-Long-and-Wide went back. And they were very happy. They stopped thinking evil of one another. They made peace. This is the end.

1 The singer represents chiefs on opposite sides as speaking. One asks the other to come to him, calling him by the honorable term for "chief," "ki'lsLa-i;" and the other does come, because he hears himself so called. 2 This story is rather curious, inasmuch as the interest in it seems to be similar to that which we experience in the story of Robinson Crusoe. It is evidently a corrupted version of the Tlingit story about the founding of Tongas. though in that the scene opens near Klawak. 3 One of the towns occupied by those Haida who went to Alaska, and are now called the Kaigani. It is on the east side of Cordova Bay. The principal family there is called Middle-Town-People.

Then those who were in the house came down to meet them. And they were very happy over it. Then they threw the bodies out. Then they began to carry them up. They put them into the house after they had carried the canoe up to the woods. Then they began to take off the skins. And they took off all. But next day they put sticks in the edges (to spread them). And they hung them up in the house. They ate the meat. When the skins were dried, they again went out to get some.

When it was cooked, they began to eat. And they stretched the sea-otterskins and hung them up. But they did not eat fish. They threw the sea-otter-meat into the sea, and halibut swam up for it. When he had sharpened the end of a stick with the stone axe, (their leader) went out with it, and speared (a halibut). The water was shallow. And he went ashore with it, and threw it up from the stick. After they had clubbed it there for a while, it was dead. Two people carried it up. Then he put stones into the fire for it. When the stones were hot, he cut it up. He put it into the box. When it was cooked, he took the covers off. They found a flat piece of driftwood like a tray. And they used this.

And when the canoe was full, he went back. And they also skinned these. When the skins were dried, they put them in one place. But they used some of them for bait. And they also used the big ones for blankets. They went out every morning. And the halibut also swam up there for the meat. In winter they did not get them.

And when they had obtained a great deal of cedar-bark, they brought it out of the woods on their backs. And when they came out, those who took care of the canoe saw salmon in the stream. rhese were humpbacks. And five were in a deep water-hole. Then they broke off a long stick and launched it at them. And they killed all five of them. And they put them into the canoe. This was the first time they had seen salmon. And when they came back and saw them, they were very glad. When they had put all of the cedar-bark into the canoe, they started away. And they arrived at their house. And they put the cedar-bark into the house. They also put the salmon into the house.

They made four bundles for each man. And each kept two (skins) for himself, because they were afraid of being cold in the canoe. Then they began to cook sea-ottermeat to eat in the canoe. They did not steam it. They only roasted it. They went to bed. Next day, when day broke, they started out. And they crossed to the other side. And they arrived at GasqE'ginia while it was still light. Their house still stood there. They brought the sea-otters into this. At that time they were very strong. Then they had become very big men. Then they roasted the sea-otter-meat on sticks. And when they had eaten, they began questioning him. "From whence are we?" they said to him. He said to them, "Your fathers' town is close by. While you were very small, I took you and I went away with you. And now I am going back to your fathers with you." Thus he said to them. Then they were very happy, for they thought that their fathers would know them. And next day they started off. And in the evening they came to the town of Klinkwan. All the people of the town went down to the beach, because there were many people in the canoe. And they took them into one house. And they took the seaotters into the house. And after they had made them sit down, they gave them food. They did not know what

people they were. Their parents did not recognize them, for they were bearded. When they were through eating, they were going to question the canoecaptain. "Where do you come from?" they said to him. He, however, knew them. He had not forgotten them. "I am from Q!a'gan,"' said he. "Did you get those sea-otters there?" they said to him. "Yes," he said. "Did you do it alone?" said they to him. And he said, "Yes, I did it alone." They said to him, "What did you kill them with?" - "I (killed them) with this club," he said. They said to him, "What are the names of those people?" He knew all of their names. At that time he began telling them their names. And when they heard the names, they recognized the names of their children. But still they doubted (at first). They thought that he was lying. Then their mothers took them to their houses. They led all there. And (the youths) also gave them their seaotter-skins. They gave all of the seaotters to their parents. And the man who was their chief also gave all of his to his uncle. When he gave them to his uncle, he made his uncle's mind glad. So he let him marry his daughter. Here it comes to a point (i. e., the end).

APPENDIX. - VOCABULARY.
The following lists contain the stems of words, prefixes, and suffixes, and a few examples to illustrate their use in composition. The figures refer to the page and line, of the present volume. The lists are not complete, but contain most of the stems that have been ascertained with certainty. On account of the almost unavoidable errors due to misinterpretation of similar sounds, the material has been so artanged that words of similar form are placed as near together as possible. This has been accomplished by making the alphabetical arrangement such that groups of similar sounds are always treated as units. The order in which the sounds and groups of sounds are arranged is as follows:Aa e ae e i y a o u w h b p
