Morphological Variation in a Unisexual Whiptail 

Lizard (Aspidoscelis exsanguis) and One of Its Bisexual 

Parental Species (Aspidoscelis inornata) (Reptilia: 

Squamata: Teiidae): Is the Clonal Species Less Variable?

CHARLES J. COLE,1 HARRY L. TAYLOR,1, 2 AND CAROL R. TOWNSEND1

ABSTRACT

Two clonal lineages, each comprising multiple generations of unisexual A. exsanguis, were 
produced in the laboratory from two lizards that were collected at the same locality in the field. 
Based on 10 meristic and four additional characters, we assessed morphological scores and 
relative variation as follows: (1) between the two laboratory lineages; (2) between these lineages 
pooled and samples of A. exsanguis and the bisexual (gonochoristic) A. inornata from the field; 
and (3) between field samples of the clonal lizards and A. inornata from a nearby locality. The 
two lineages differed significantly in the means and variances of two univariate characters and 
the two most informative multivariate characters. Contrary to expectations, the pooled sample 
of cloned laboratory lineages of A. exsanguis were as variable as the bisexual species in all 10 
univariate characters and four important multivariate characters.

INTRODUCTION

Individuals of all-female species of whiptail lizards (genus Aspidoscelis) reproduce by parthe-
nogenetic cloning (Lutes et al., 2010). This preserves the high levels of heterozygosity that result 
from their hybrid origins (reviewed by Reeder et al., 2002) and explains their very low levels of 
variation in genetic characters, such as allozymes (e.g., Neaves, 1969; Parker and Selander, 1976;

Dessauer and Cole, 1986; Taylor et al., 2015) and microsatellite DNA (Lutes et al., 2011). Nonle-
thal mutations can produce new or derived lineages of parthenogens, as they are cloned, so 
multiple  clonal  lineages  can  occur  in  populations  of  unisexual  whiptail  lizards  (Parker  and 
Selander, 1976; Dessauer and Cole, 1989; Lutes et al., 2011). Different clones can also result from 
separate original F1 hybrid zygotes (e.g., Cole and Dessauer, 1993; Lutes et al., 2011).

Considering the clonal inheritance, one might expect to find comparatively little variation 
in morphological characters of unisexual versus bisexual species. For example, if a partheno-
genetic female has a count of 70 epidermal scales or granules around the middle of the body, 
17 epidermal femoral pores on the right thigh, and 30 epidermal subdigital lamellae on the left 
fourth toe, is it likely that her offspring will have the same scale counts? Alternatively, if there 
is variation in such characters in parthenogens, is it less than what occurs in bisexual (gono-
choristic) species, including ancestors of the clonal forms? For the variation that does exist 
within a clone, to what might this be attributed? Taylor et al. (2012) found surprising variation 
in a clonal species (Aspidoscelis tesselata) compared with three bisexual species, including its 
two progenitor relatives, based on population samples collected in the field. However, compara-
tive variation within clonal lineages represented by multiple generations of known heritage has 
not been studied in detail, although data for two lineages of Aspidoscelis neavesi were presented 
by Cole et al. (2014) (discussed below).

Here we compare variation in 14 morphological characters representing each of two clonal 
lineages of parthenogenetic Aspidoscelis exsanguis that were produced in the laboratory. The 
two lineages stemmed from different P1 females, but both were collected at the same locality 
in the field. These P1 females are AMNH R-109468 and AMNH R-113352. The specimens 
represent the F1–F7 generations of the AMNH R-109468 lineage and the F1–F3 generations of 
the AMNH R-113352 lineage. Representatives of these lineages, including some of the same 
individuals, were used to document parthenogenetic reproduction (Hardy and Cole, 1981) and 
clonal inheritance (Dessauer and Cole, 1986) in unisexual whiptail lizards, so we know that 
these phenomena pertain to these specimens. We also studied variation in a population sample 
of A. exsanguis from the same locality in nature where the P1 females were obtained, comparing 
this with variation in the two laboratory lineages pooled (assuming that there are pooled lin-
eages in the field sample) and with variation in a bisexual species, Aspidoscelis inornata from 
a nearby locality, as this is one of the bisexual ancestors of A. exsanguis. Finally, we compared 
variation in only the field samples of A. exsanguis and A. inornata and briefly discuss possible 
morphological effects of the laboratory environment, although none was found.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Morphological Characters

The  characters  analyzed  with  multivariate  statistics  are  discrete  counts  of  epidermal 
scales and pores in the skin. The characters and their abbreviations are described in appendix 
1, along with snout-vent length. Additional characters are described in the text where they 
are discussed.

Specimens Examined

All specimens are at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), and they are listed 
in appendix 2. As all the specimens of A. exsanguis are females, we examined only females of A. 
inornata also, although these characters are not known to be sexually dimorphic in these lizards.

Laboratory Maintenance of Reproducing Lizards

Lizards in laboratory colonies were maintained at the AMNH as described by Townsend 
(1979) and Townsend and Cole (1985). Following oviposition, eggs were removed from the 
cage and allowed to develop at room temperature.

Statistics

Statistical procedures and tests were performed with SPSS© and NCSS© software. We used 
a modified Levene test (recommended by Conover et al. [1981] and available in NCSS©) to 
check for significant pairwise differences in sample variances. For sample pairs with heteroge-
neous variances, we used relative size of standard deviations to identify the sample with sig-
nificantly greater variation. Depending on number of samples compared, we used either t-tests 
or one-way ANOVAs to test for significant differences in character means. If significant differ-
ences were indicated by ANOVAs, the specifically different samples were identified with Tukey 
multiple-comparison tests.

All specimens were scored for 10 univariate meristic characters (appendix 1), and speci-
mens with complete data for the 10 characters formed the base data for the multivariate com-
parisons. For each comparison, the subgroup of original samples used was treated as a single 
sample in a principal components analysis (PCA), and meristic variation for that subgroup was 
captured in the 10 principal components derived from that analysis. Because all characters were 
recorded on the same scale (discrete counts of epidermal scales and femoral pores), we used 
the variance/covariance matrix to obtain the coefficients used to compute component scores. 
A variance/covariance matrix retains the relative variances of the original characters, so that 
characters with larger variances are given greater weight in developing the principal compo-
nents (Neff and Marcus, 1980).

Following Jombart et al. (2010), we used either a discriminate function analysis (DFA) or 
a canonical variate analysis (CVA) of the principal components (as new variables) to determine 
similarities and significant differences among the original samples included in the comparisons. 
Principal components were included stepwise in a DFA or CVA model if F-to-enter probabili-
ties were < 0.05 and did not exceed 0.10 when other components were included. 

For each comparison, we checked each sample (a priori group) for multivariate outliers by 
evaluating D2 distances (based on the original a priori groups) from each specimen to the 
centroid of the remaining cases in that group (provided as output by SPSS). Specimens with 
D2 values exceeding a critical chi-square value at P = 0.001 and degrees of freedom defined by 
the number of principal components included in the CVA model would be identified as outliers 
and removed from the definitive analyses (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013). However, there were 
no multivariate outliers identified in the multivariate comparisons of this study.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Statistical Comparisons of Two Cloned Lineages

Here  we  address  three  related  questions:  (1)  are  the  two  field-collected  P1 females 
alike in quantitative expressions of morphological characters; (2) do all specimens in a 
cloned lineage resemble each other and the founder of the lineage in scores of the mor-
phological characters; and (3) are there significant differences in morphological charac-
ters  and  the  extent  of  their  variation  between  two  laboratory  lineages  cloned  from  the 
same natural population?

Note that the two P1 females were similar or identical in most characters except GAB 
and TBS (table 1) and there was a range of data for all characters, not consistent uniformity. 
In some characters (GUL, TBS, LSG(u)), a P1 female had scores that were outside the range

of variation observed in her cloned derivatives (table 1). For univariate comparisons, the 
lineage from AMNH R-109468 included 39–46 specimens and that from AMNH R-113352 
included 14–16 (table 1), depending on the number of characters that could not be scored 
owing to physical damage. The lineages differed significantly in two of the 10 meristic char-
acters (GAB and COS(u); table 1), but not in TBS. Considering the differences between the 
P1 females in GAB (table 1), these two lineages may represent two different clones from the 
natural population.

Aspidoscelis neavesi is the only other clonal whiptail for which data can be compared for 
individuals of two different laboratory lineages, and the same characters were studied for those 
lizards (Cole et al., 2014: 10, table 2). Interestingly, the maternal parent for A. neavesi was an 
A. exsanguis, and the observed range for all characters studied in A. neavesi was similar to that 
of the A. exsanguis reported here also. The two lineages of A. neavesi differed significantly in 
two characters, SPV and FP, although the actual differences were small (Cole et al., 2014). 
Nevertheless, the founders of those lineages were females from different F1 hybrid zygotes of 
A. exsanguis × A. inornata (Lutes et al., 2011).

We included all 10 univariate characters in a PCA to initiate multivariate comparisons 
(table 2). Samples for PCA and DFA were reduced to 28 specimens of the AMNH R-109468 
lineage and 14 of the AMNH R-113352 lineage because 20 individuals had damage to at least 
one character. We used the 10 principal components, generated in the PCA, as potential can-
didate variables for DFA of the two lineages. Two of the 10 principal components (PC1 and 
PC6) were selected by the stepwise selection criteria (Materials and Methods) for inclusion in 
the DFA model (table 2). 

The two lineages differed significantly in PC1 and discriminant function 1 (DF1; table 1), 
and the Wilks’ lambda value of 0.424 (P <0.0001) suggested that differences between the two 
lineages were responsible for approximately 58% of the variation. This variation was sufficient 
to classify more than 85% of the specimens to the correct a priori group (table 3). In relative 
variation, as depicted by standard deviations, lineage AMNH R-113352 was significantly more 
variable than lineage AMNH R-109468 in GAB, PC1, and DF1, and lineage AMNH R-109468 
was more variable in COS (table 1).

Comparisons of Unisexual A. exsanguis, Bisexual A. inornata, and 

Two Lineages of A. exsanguis

In univariate and multivariate statistical comparisons of field samples of unisexual A. 
exsanguis, bisexual A. inornata, and a pooled sample of two laboratory lineages of A. exsan-
guis, we address three related questions: (1) does the field sample of clonal A. exsanguis differ 
from the sample of pooled laboratory lineages of this species; (2) is the field sample of A. 
exsanguis less variable than the field sample of A. inornata; and (3) is the pooled sample of 
the two laboratory lineages of A. exsanguis less variable than either or both the field samples 
of A. exsanguis and A. inornata? For these comparisons, we pooled the data for the two labo-
ratory lineages of A. exsanguis because the field sample of this species must have included 
more than one lineage.

In univariate comparisons of 10 meristic characters, the only difference between the sample 
of field A. exsanguis and the pooled clones of laboratory A. exsanguis was in SDL-F(u), although 
this character did not differ between the field samples of A. exsanguis and A. inornata (table 
4). There were significant differences in the means of seven of the 10 univariate characters 
among the three samples and there was a considerable range of variation for each character in 
each sample. Six of the significant differences were interspecific.

Thirty-three specimens had one or more damaged characters, thereby precluding use of 
those individuals in the multivariate analyses. We used all 10 univariate characters in the PCA 
model, and seven of the 10 principal components generated were selected by stepwise selection 
criteria as having value in discriminating the three a priori groups (table 5). Field-caught and 
laboratory A. exsanguis both differed significantly from field A. inornata (but not from each 
other) in PC1 and CV1, laboratory A. exsanguis differed significantly from field A. inornata 
but not field A. exsanguis in PC2, and laboratory A. exsanguis differed significantly from field 
A. exsanguis but not field A. inornata in CV2 (table 4). These results are visually depicted in 
figure 1. A Wilks’ lambda value of 0.071 for the combination of CV1 + CV2 in the CVA model 
(table  5)  suggested  that  differences  among  the  three  a  priori  groups  were  responsible  for 
approximately 93% of the variation. Classification success of specimens from the original a 
priori groups was 78.4%. All 19 specimens of A. inornata were classified correctly, but 7 of the 
13 specimens of field A. exsanguis were classified to laboratory A.  exsanguis, and 12 of 42 
specimens of laboratory A. exsanguis were classified to field A. exsanguis.

In variation of univariate characters, significant differences among the three samples were 
found with SPV and TBS (table 4). For SPV, field A. inornata was more variable than field A. 
exsanguis (P = 0.02) but not laboratory A. exsanguis. For TBS, field A. exsanguis was more 
variable than laboratory A. exsanguis (P = 0.001) but the variation in A. inornata was not dif-
ferent from either sample of A. exsanguis. For multivariate characters, laboratory A. exsanguis 
expressed greater variation than field A. exsanguis for PC1 (P = 0.02) but was similar to A. 
inornata (table 4; fig. 1). The same relative degree of variability was expressed by all three 
groups for PC2, CV1, and CV2 (table 4; fig. 1); i.e., the sexual A. inornata was not more vari-
able than the clonal A. exsanguis in these characters.

Comparisons of Field Samples of A. exsanguis and A. inornata

Is  it  possible  that  aspects  of  the  laboratory  environment  (e.g.,  temperature  during  egg 
incubation) have biased variation of morphological characters in the specimens of the labora-
tory lineages? As a check on this possibility, we repeated the comparisons here but included 
only the specimens obtained in the field (although we realize that differing environmental 
factors at the two localities might have affected development of the characters).

The field samples of A. exsanguis and A. inornata differed significantly in 6 of 10 univariate 
meristic characters (table 6), but we included all 10 characters in a PCA to obtain principal 
components to use as characters in a discriminate function analysis (table 7). Samples included 
in the PCA and DFA were reduced to 13 specimens of A. exsanguis and 19 of A. inornata 
because 13 individuals had damage to one or more characters. Six of the 10 principal compo-
nents were selected by stepwise selection criteria (Materials and Methods) for inclusion in the 
DFA to discriminate the two samples (table 7). 

The two species differed significantly in principal component 1 (PC1) and discriminant func-
tion 1 (DF1; table 6), and a Wilks’ lambda value of 0.073 (P < 0.0001) suggested that interspecific 
differences were responsible for approximately 93% of the variation. There were no misclassifica-
tions among the 32 specimens. Only one character, SPV, had a significant interspecific difference 
in variance, with A. inornata being more variable than A. exsanguis (table 6).

Variation in Additional Characters

Our focus above has been on scalation characters that normally vary in Aspidoscelis, both 
from individual to individual within species and often with different ranges of variation from 
species to species and character to character. There are also scalation characters that are essen-
tially  invariant  within  groups  of  closely  related  species,  so  much  so  that  they  characterize 
members of species groups and genera of teiids. For example, all species of the sexlineata spe-
cies group of Aspidoscelis, which includes both A. exsanguis and A. inornata, normally have 2 
frontoparietal scales, 3 parietal scales, and 4 supraocular scales (each side) on the head (Lowe 
et al., 1970), and all species of the genus Aspidoscelis normally have 8 rows of large ventral 
scutes across midbody (Reeder et al., 2002). At higher levels of taxonomy, there are many scale 
characters that are taxonomically useful because they are essentially invariant within families 
but different from family to family. Consequently, it appears as if development of certain scale 
characters is canalized, while many are not, and we know nothing about the evolutionary sig-
nificance of this. The following observations pertain to four characters that usually are thought 
of as essentially invariant.

Postantebrachial Scales on Forearm: the typical condition in A. exsanguis is for these 
scales (Duellman and Zweifel, 1962) to be enlarged and angular in shape, and this was the 
condition in all specimens examined, including 46 of the AMNH R-109468 lineage, 16 of the 
AMNH R-113352 lineage, and 19 of the field sample. The typical condition in A. inornata is 
for these scales to be smaller although somewhat enlarged, and this was the condition in all 
specimens examined, including 26 of the field sample.

Mesoptychial Scales Across Throat: These scales are on the anterior edge of the 
posterior gular fold on the throat. The typical condition in A. exsanguis is for these scales 
to be abruptly larger than the scales in the fold, rather large, and angular in shape, and 
this was the condition in all specimens examined, including 46 of the AMNH R-109468 
lineage, 16 of the AMNH R-113352 lineage, and 19 of the field sample. The typical condi-
tion  in A.  inornata  is  for  these  scales  to  be  somewhat  enlarged  and  slightly  angular  in 
shape as compared to A. exsanguis, and this was the condition in all specimens examined, 
including 26 of the field sample.

Enlarged Ventral Scutes across Belly: On each specimen examined, these scales 
were counted in several places posterior to midbody. As is typical for the genus, nearly every 
specimen of A. exsanguis consistently had 8, including 44 of the AMNH R-109468 lineage, 16 
of the AMNH R-113352 lineage, and 19 of the field sample. For one specimen of the R-109468 
lineage (AMNH R-134888) the number of rows was reduced to 7 posterior to midbody, and 
for another individual the character could not be scored. Also, for 8 specimens (50%) in the 
R-113352 lineage, there were additional atypical enlarged ventrolateral scales beside the later-
almost ventral scute. For A. inornata, all 26 specimens in the field sample consistently had 8 
rows, but AMNH R-131062 had additional atypical enlarged ventrolateral scales beside the 
lateralmost ventral scute.

Enlarged Ventral Preanal Scales: These scales were recorded as occurring in one of 
three conditions. In Type I there are 3 enlarged scales, 2 bordering the vent and 1 anterior to 
these. In Type II there are 2 enlarged scales, 1 bordering the vent and 1 anterior to it. Most speci-
mens of Aspidoscelis have one or the other of these conditions. However, specimens with a dif-
ferent pattern of preanal scalation were scored in a catchall alternative called Type III. There was 
considerable variation in this character (table 8), although more than 50% of the four samples 
(the two laboratory lineages and two field samples) had Type I, but more than 20% of each sample 
had Type III. Type II was more common in A. inornata than A. exsanguis.

Did the Laboratory Environment Affect Morphological Characters?

It has been documented for various species of reptiles that environmental factors can affect 
the development of certain morphological characters, including some scale counts and certain 
important features such as sex determination (e.g., Fox, 1948; Osgood, 1978; Bull and Vogt, 
1979; and Andrews et al., 2000). Consequently, we considered whether the laboratory environ-
ment affected development of some of the characters studied.

When a clutch was laid, we weighed it and divided by the number of eggs to estimate the 
weight of one egg in that clutch. Because eggs were incubated at room temperature, which 
varied, we recorded the number of days to hatching as a proxy for temperature. Finally, upon 
hatching, we recorded the weight and SVL of the hatchlings (table 9). Because GAB was the 
scale character with the widest range of variation, we compared that character with these life 
history variables. We used specimens having complete data for both lineages (AMNH R-109468 
lineage N = 30; AMNH R-113352 lineage N = 8) in multiple regression analyses and regression 
of GAB on number of days to hatching, using data for the two lineages both separated and 
pooled (to increase sample size). No clear relationships were found.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

For the characters we examined, there is no general pattern that shows clonal A. exsan-
guis as less variable than bisexual A. inornata. All meristic characters had a range of varia-
tion  in  the  two  laboratory  lineages  compared,  not  a  fixed  condition  from  individual  to 
individual (table 1).

The two lineages of A. exsanguis cloned in the laboratory from field females collected at 
the same locality differed in 2 out of 10 meristic characters (GAB and COS(u); table 1). This 
is consistent with the theory that a population sample of a parthenogenetic species can consist 
of more than one clone, although we do not know whether the cause of these meristic differ-
ences is based on differences in DNA. This is consistent also with two laboratory clones of A. 
neavesi differing in 2 out of the same 10 characters (SPV and FP; Cole et al., 2014), and the 

16 

AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES 

NO. 3849

clutches of A. neavesi were also all incubated at one temperature (28° C), in this case at the 
Stowers Institute for Medical Research (D.P. Baumann, personal commun.). In general, the 
standard errors of the univariate variation of the 10 characters were similar in the A. exsanguis 
reported here and the A. neavesi reported by Cole et al. (2014), except that the standard errors 
were  clearly  higher  in  GAB,  SDL-F(u),  GUL,  and  PSC  in  the  lineage  of  AMNH  R-113352 
reported here, which is the smallest sample.

Comparing standard deviations, the lineage of AMNH R-113352 was more variable than 
the lineage of AMNH R-109468 in GAB, PC1, and DF1, but the lineage of AMNH R-109468 
was more variable in COS(u).

In univariate comparisons of 10 meristic characters of the field A. exsanguis versus the two 
laboratory lineages of A. exsanguis pooled, the only significant difference was in SDL-F(u) 
(table 4), but this character did not differ between the field A. exsanguis and A. inornata. Inter-
estingly, this character did not differ between the two lineages (table 1) and the two characters 
that did differ between the lineages (GAB and COS) were not significantly different in this 
comparison (table 4). In multivariate characters, PC1 and CV1 of the field and laboratory A. 
exsanguis differed from A. inornata but not from each other; PC2 of laboratory A. exsanguis 
differed from A. inornata but not from field A. exsanguis; and CV2 differed between the field 
versus pooled laboratory lineages of A. exsanguis (table 4), but neither sample of A. exsanguis 
differed from A. inornata in this character. It appears as if samples of parthenogens collected 
in the field may be pooled samples of different clones, for which the distinctions may be con-
cealed within the overall sample.

Clonal laboratory A. exsanguis was not less variable than bisexual A. inornata in any of the 
10 univariate characters (table 4). In univariate comparisons, only SPV and TBS showed signifi-
cant differences in variation. For TBS, field A. exsanguis was more variable than laboratory A. 
exsanguis, but neither sample differed from A. inornata in variation in this character. For SPV, 
bisexual A. inornata was more variable than the field A. exsanguis but not more so than the 
sample of two pooled laboratory clones (table 4). In multivariate comparisons of variation among 
these samples, the only difference was that the pooled lineages of cloned laboratory A. exsanguis 
showed greater variation in PC1 than the field sample of this species, but the variability of A. 
inornata was similar to both samples of A. exsanguis in this character. There were no differences 
in variation between A. exsanguis and A. inornata in PC2, CV1, and CV2 (table 4). The absence 
of differences in variability of the multivariate characters was also exhibited in comparing the 
field samples of A. exsanguis versus field samples of A. inornata (compare tables 4 and 6). In 
univariate comparisons of the field samples only, SPV was the only character that showed a dif-
ference in variation, which was higher in A. inornata than in A. exsanguis (table 6).

With respect to additional characters (e.g., number of enlarged ventral scutes across the belly), 
it would be interesting to know why (canalization?) certain characters are essentially invariant from 
individual to individual, whether members of the same lineage or not. Also, while many characters 
vary, the range of observed variation appears to be constrained to some extent, and the amount of 
the observed range also varies from character to character. In any event, we have no clear evidence 
that the laboratory environment affected development of the characters we studied.

APPENDIX 1

Character Abbreviations

Abbreviations  for  morphological  characters  examined  are  listed  below.  Any  character 
abbreviation followed by (u) indicates that it is a paired character and the count used is from 
one side of the body (unilateral; the right side, but the left side if the right could not be counted, 
as in table 1). This maximizes sample size, and the paired characters used this way normally 
do not show asymmetry in Aspidoscelis, including hybrids (e.g., Dessauer et al., 2000: 99–101). 
If a paired character is not followed by (u), the total of both sides is presented.  

COS(u), number of circumorbital semicircle scales (following Wright and Lowe, 1967, 

using the count from the right side of the head, but left side if right could not be counted).
FP(u), number of femoral pores on right leg, but left leg if right could not be counted. 
GAB, number of dorsal scales (granules) around midbody, following Wright and Lowe 

(1967).

GUL, number of gular scales, following Cole et al. (1988).
LSG(u), number of lateral supraocular granules (on right side of head, whether in one or 
two rows, but left side if right could not be counted) between the supraoculars and supercili-
aries, counting forward from an imaginary line extended from the suture between the third 
and fourth supraoculars toward the superciliaries, following Walker et al. (1966).

PSC, total number of scales in contact with outer perimeter of parietal and interparietal 

scales, following Cole et al. (2010).

SDL-F(u), number of subdigital lamellae on the right fourth finger, but using the left finger 

if the right could not be counted, following Taylor et al. (2001).

SDL-T(u), number of subdigital lamellae on the right fourth toe, but using the left toe if 

the right could not be counted, following Cole et al. (1988).

SPV, number of granules (scales) between the paravertebral light stripes at midbody, fol-

lowing Wright and Lowe (1967).

SVL, snout-vent (body) length, in mm.
TBS, number of enlarged dorsal scales around dorsal aspect of base of tail; the count is made 
while holding the hind legs at the hip perpendicular to the body and counting on an imaginary 
line along the posterior edges of the legs, but not including lateral granules on the tail.
