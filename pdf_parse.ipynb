      "\n",
      "The Archisargoidea is a superfamily of brachyceran flies that comprises four families, 26 \n",
      "genera, and 69 described species that occurred in the Late Mesozoic from the Middle Jurassic \n",
      "to the Late Cretaceous. They were stout bodied to gracile flies with a relatively generalized wing \n",
      "venation, large eyes, and in eight genera (10 species) where the female terminalia are preserved \n",
      "these are modified into a very distinctive aculeate, piercing structure. If the Archisargoidea is \n",
      "monophyletic, which the oviscapt strongly suggests (albeit incompletely surveyed), this super-\n",
      "family would be the largest extinct lineage of brachyceran flies. \n",
      "\n",
      "This paper was prompted by the senior author’s discovery of a complete female specimen \n",
      "in mid-Cretaceous amber from northern Burma, recently described on the basis of three other \n",
      "females as Zhenia xiai (Q.-Q. Zhang et al., 2016). This species is the first Eremochaetidae found \n",
      "in amber, and the latest occurrence of the family. Preservation of the new AMNH specimen is \n",
      "so beautiful that even the original color patterns are intact, a fidelity that allows a detailed \n",
      "review of obscure characters, especially ones that are critical to the phylogenetic placement of \n",
      "this enigmatic group of flies. All other eremochaetids are lithified fossils. Preservation in shales \n",
      "of even the finest grain (e.g., Early Cretaceous of Yixian and Zaza formations) rarely allows one \n",
      "to observe minute structures such as tibial spurs, maxillary palpomeres, and a pretarsal empo-\n",
      "dium, particularly in determining whether such structures are definitely absent. The Tethepo-\n",
      "myiidae,  placed  within  Archisargoidea  based  on  the  aculeate  oviscapt,  are  known  only  in \n",
      "Cretaceous amber, but the mouthparts, antennae, and wing venation of these tiny flies are too \n",
      "reduced to be revealing about the relationships of archisargoids to other flies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhenia has features of several genera in Archisargidae and Eremochaetidae, and so it was \n",
      "decided that a phylogenetic analysis of Archisargoidea was needed. Indeed, the taxonomy of \n",
      "Archisargoidea has been assembled piecemeal, with species and genera described by 10 pri-\n",
      "mary/lead authors in 32 papers, generally as new material became available. Most of the tax-\n",

      "shank and Ko (2003) are the primary source on the geology of Burmese amber. These outcrops \n",
      "are entirely surrounded by extensive Quaternary and Tertiary exposures. Amber was recently \n",
      "recorded from the Magway Region, Central Myanmar, but as yet no arthropod inclusions have \n",
      "been reported (Sun et al., 2015). Grimaldi et al. (2002) estimated the origin of the main, Kachin \n",
      "deposits as Cenomanian to Turonian in age, based on the stratigraphic distributions of various \n",

      "Albian (105–100 Ma) based on a Mortoniceras ammonite from the outcrop sediments. The \n",
      "latter age corresponds closely to the Early Cenomanian age (99 Ma) estimated by Shi et al. \n",
      "(2012), based on U-Pb radiometric dating of zircons of the amber sediments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A detailed redescription of Zhenia xiai is provided here because some of the features in \n",
      "specimens studied by Zhang et al. (2016) were not observable (i.e., palp segmentation, body \n",
      "coloration, antennal sockets), or they are ones whose morphological interpretations we differ \n",
      "with (i.e., pretarsal, oviscapt, antennal structure).\n",

      "The specimen was received as a small squared, polished piece of amber 10 × 13.5 mm, 4 \n",
      "mm. thickness, which required no further trimming and polishing; further trimming would \n",
      "cut into portions of the fly. Photomicrography and measurements used a Nikon SMZ1500 \n",
      "stereoscope with 16 MP Nikon digital camera with Nikon DIS imaging software (including \n",
      "z-stacking).  CT  scanning  of  the  specimen  was  not  done  because  all  external  details  were \n",
      "observable. Compiling a data matrix for phylogenetic analysis of Archisargoidea relied upon \n",
      "published  descriptions  and  diagrams  of  taxa  from  the  Jurassic  and  Cretaceous  of  Eurasia, \n",
      "China, and Australia (citations listed above). Taxa described from Russia and Kazakhstan are \n",

      "Twenty-two of the 32 characters are from the wing, and we were very deliberate to score \n",
      "exemplar species in which details of the head (e.g., antennae, frontal margins of eyes) and \n",
      "abdomen (e.g., female terminalia) were preserved, not just the wing. A total of 46 exemplar \n",

      "the R4-R5 fork is larger and nearly symmetrical; and cell cup is open. Thus, the fusion of the \n",
