ABSTRACT

Prince Maximilian zu Wied’s great exploration of coastal Brazil in 1815–1817 resulted in 
important collections of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, many of which were new 
species later described by Wied himself. The bulk of his collection was purchased for the Amer-
ican Museum of Natural history in 1869, although many “type specimens” had disappeared 
earlier. Wied carefully identified his localities but did not designate type specimens or type 
localities, which are taxonomic concepts that were not yet established.

information and manuscript names on a fraction (17 species) of his Brazilian reptiles and 
amphibians were transmitted by Wied to Prof. heinrich Rudolf Schinz at the university of 
zurich. Schinz included these species (credited to their discoverer “Princ. Max.”) in the second 
volume of Das Thierreich . . . (1822). Most are junior objective synonyms of names published 
by Wied.

however, six of the 17 names used by Schinz predate Wied’s own publications. Three were 
manuscript names never published by Wied because he determined the species to be previously 
known. (1) Lacerta vittata Schinz, 1822 (a nomen oblitum) = Lacerta striata sensu Wied (a 
misidentification, non linnaeus nec sensu Merrem) = Kentropyx calcarata Spix, 1825, herein 
qualified as a nomen protectum. (2) Polychrus virescens Schinz, 1822 = Lacerta marmorata 
linnaeus, 1758 (now Polychrus marmoratus). (3) Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822 (a nomen obli-
tum) = Gymnophthalmus quadrilineatus sensu Wied (a misidentification, non linnaeus nec 
sensu Merrem) = Micrablepharus maximiliani (Reinhardt and lütken, “1861” [1862]), herein 
qualified as a nomen protectum. Qualifying Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822, as a nomen oblitum 
also removes the problem of homonymy with the later-named Pacific skink Scincus cyanurus 
lesson (= Emoia cyanura).

The remaining three names used by Schinz are senior objective synonyms that take priority 
over Wied’s names. (4) Bufo cinctus Schinz, 1822, is senior to Bufo cinctus Wied, 1823; both, 
however,  are  junior  synonyms  of  Bufo  crucifer  Wied,  1821  =  Chaunus  crucifer  (Wied).  (5) 
Agama picta Schinz, 1822, is senior to Agama picta Wied, 1823, requiring a change of author-
ship for this poorly known species, to be known as Enyalius pictus (Schinz). (6) Lacerta cya-
nomelas Schinz, 1822, predates Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–1831)—both nomina oblita. 
Wied’s illustration and description shows cyanomelas as apparently conspecific with the recently 
described but already well-known Cnemidophorus nativo Rocha et al., 1997, which is the valid 
name because of its qualification herein as a nomen protectum.

The preceding specific name cyanomelas (as corrected in an errata section) is misspelled 
several ways in different copies of Schinz’s original description (“cyanomlas,” “cyanom  las,” and 
“cyanom”). loosening, separation, and final loss of the last three letters of movable type in the 
printing chase probably accounts for the variant misspellings.

iNTRoDuCTioN

in the years 1815–1817, Maximilian Alexander Philipp, Prinz zu Wied-Neuwied,4 traveled 
extensively along the Atlantic coast of eastern Brazil and assembled important zoological col-
lections. The principal scientific results of his great Brazilian expedition were described in three 
classic works. The two-volume Reise (Wied, 1820–1821) is a report of his travel and includes 
some footnote descriptions of new species, but most new taxa date from the following two 

4 Prince Maximilian’s given names sometimes are arranged incorrectly as “Alexander Philipp Maximilian.” More 
importantly, there are permutations of his family name and much confusion as to how it should be cited. 
Briefly, the family Wied-Neuwied inherited the estate of Wied-Runkel in 1824 and geographic modifiers of 
the Wied name were officially dropped that year. long before that, the prince’s normal signature in corre-
spondence was “Max P z Wied.” he did not publish under the compound name Wied-Neuwied after 1824 
except (for editorial continuity) on the title pages of the Abbildungen, which had begun publication in 1822. 
All his species names can properly be referenced simply as “Wied,” following the prince’s own preference 
and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (1998, rule 22.2C1) that mandate use of the latest form of a changed 
name. (NB: in the notable case of linnaeus vs. the late-in-life ennobled “von linné,” this rule is followed in 
modern library catalogs but long ignored in most taxonomic literature.) The noble preposition von some-
times replaces the zu in Wied’s name in library catalogs, rarely on the printed page (see footnote 12).

works. The Abbildungen (Wied, 1822–1831) comprise 90 folio plates of Brazilian animals; these 
were published in 15 issues (lieferungen/livraisons), each with six unnumbered plates accom-
panied by short texts in german and french. All the species, illustrated or not, were extensively 
described in the four-volume Beiträge, of which the first volume is devoted to herpetology 
(Wied, 1825). After finishing his studies of the Brazilian material, Prince Maximilian under-
took his famous North American expedition, sailing to Boston in 1832 and exploring along the 
Missouri River in 1833–1834; another comprehensive set of publications followed (see espe-
cially Wied, 1839–1841).

After the prince’s death, the bulk of his collection was purchased in 1869 for the American 
Museum of Natural history (Myers, 2000: 7). Some, albeit not all, his “type specimens” were 
in the material sent to the American Museum. Prince Maximilian carefully associated localities 
with his specimens, but he did not designate type specimens or type localities—taxonomic 
concepts not yet established in his day. Vanzolini and Myers (unpublished) collaborated in a 
survey especially of the Brazilian materials, in an effort to determine retrospective type status 
of specimens illustrated and described by Prince Maximilian zu Wied, whom we hereafter refer 
to simply as Wied.

Wied carried on extensive correspondence during his career and kept colleagues informed 
of his work. he not only sent complimentary copies of the Beiträge volumes and issues of the 
Abbildungen, but also transmitted not yet published descriptions of new species; he even gave 
specimens to Blasius Merrem. This procedure and generosity led to the preemption of some of 
Wied’s specific names by colleagues (Vanzolini, 1996: 211). Although the rule of strict nomen-
clatural priority had yet to be established, Wied’s new species seem usually to have been cred-
ited to him, but not, unfortunately, in ways that would establish his first authorship of names 
under modern rules of zoological nomenclature.

Schinz’s Thierreich

We are here concerned with heinrich Rudolf Schinz (1777–1861 or 1862), with whom 
Wied conducted a long friendly correspondence from 1806 until 1860 (Bosch, 1991: 39). 
Schinz, a Swiss naturalist, was one of the first professors in the university of zurich (Adler, 
2007: 51), where his students included louis Agassiz and J.J. von Tschudi. Among his publica-
tions was the four-volume Das Thierreich eingetheilt nach dem Bau der Thiere als Grundlage 
ihrer Naturgeschichte und der vergleichenden Anatomie von dem Herrn Ritter von Cuvier . . . aus 
dem Französischen frey [frei] übersetzt und mit vielen Zusätzen versehen von H.R. Schinz. Vol-
ume 2 is the one most important to herpetology (Schinz, 1822) and was cited in various places 
by Wied.

Schinz’s Thierreich is rare and seldom mentioned nowadays, in part because few libraries 
own it. Authorship usually is attributed to georges Cuvier; Wood (1931: 307), for example, 
does not list it with Schinz’s works in the Literature of Vertebrate Zoology, but under Cuvier he 
notes that it is “A faithful german translation, with additions, of Baron Cuvier’s Règne animal.” 

4

it contains too many novelties and other additions to be called a simple translation, and author-
ship is usually credited to Schinz for taxonomic purposes. Wied referred to the work as “Schinz, 
das Thierreich” and “Schinz, Règne Animal” on same-page german and french letterpress texts 
in the Abbildungen. Vanzolini (1977a: 29) pointed out that “Although this is one of the most 
frequently cited suites to Cuvier, its importance to Brasilian herpetology seems to have escaped 
general notice.”

Another german “translation” of Cuvier was published in 1832, by friedrich Siegmund 
Voigt. By this time, most of Wied’s Brazilian publications had become available, but neither 
Schinz’s Thierreich nor Voigt’s Thierreich attempted to discuss all the species treated by Wied. 
Voigt (1832) referenced the prince some 40 times, although Wied’s 1825  Beiträge contained 
accounts for nearly 90 species, including 60 named by himself. Voigt apparently was following 
after Cuvier, who “was not much concerned with completeness [and] only included well known 
species, capable of documenting his generic concepts” (Vanzolini, 1977: 22). So far as we can 
see, no reference is made to Schinz’s (1822) Thierreich in Voigt’s (1832) volume 2; Voigt’s source 
for Wied’s unpublished Polychrus virescens appears to have been Wagler (1828), not Schinz 
(1822) as might be expected (discussion below).

Schinz (1822) credited 17 species listed below to his friend “Princ. Max,” who discovered 

them in Brazil (“in Brasilien, neu von Neuwied entdeckt”).

We interpret most of Schinz’s names as objective junior synonyms (rather than simple subse-
quent usages) of names first published by Wied; they are objective synonyms because they were 
based on information provided by Wied and therefore were based on the same specimens.5

however, the six names in boldface (above and below) predate names used by Wied for 
the same species.6 Wied supplied all 17 names to Schinz and considered them as his own. in 
the Abbildungen and Beiträge, for example, he referenced Schinz by page number but omitted 
his names first published by Schinz. Wied did, however, explain his abandoned manuscript 
names used by Schinz (Lacerta vittata, Polychrus virescens, and Scincus cyanurus; see below).
Lacerta vittata: Wied transmitted this name to Schinz, but its identity has been generally 
overlooked. Peters and Donoso-Barros (1970: 152) wrote that “Stejneger, in a handwritten note 
in an interleaved copy of Boulenger, 1885, has noted that Boulenger did not include Lacerta 
vittata Schinz . . . as a species of Kentropyx. it is unclear to us what its relationship is, although 
Stejneger placed it opposite calcaratus Spix, suggesting a possible synonymy.” overlooked was 
Wied’s own explanation in the Beiträge (Wied, 1825: 186) and in letterpress Abbildungen text 
for Lacerta striata Dau[din] (Wied, 1829: lief. 13). Wied originally had intended his manu-
script name “vittata” for an undescribed species, but, after comparing it with Merrem’s (1809) 
“Borckischen Eidechse” (fig. 1), Wied followed Merrem’s later work (1820: 65) and mistakenly 
used the name Lacerta striata Daudin, 1802.7

As it turns out, however, Stejneger’s handwritten note in Boulenger’s Catalogue was pre-
scient. The species that Wied had intended to name “vittata” had indeed been undescribed 
prior to Schinz’s publication! hoogmoed (1973: 301) compared descriptions and concluded 
that Lacerta vittata Schinz, 1822, is a senior synonym of Kentropyx calcarata Spix, 1825. The 
senior name remains unused, however, and we agree with hoogmoed that Spix’s well-known 
name should be conserved (see below under Protection of Three Junior Synonyms).

Lacerta cyanomelas: Lacerta cyanomelas Schinz, 1822, is a senior objective synonym of 
Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–1831), but the situation is unusual because the correct 

5 Although Wied gave some specimens to Blasius Merrem, there is no published evidence that he ever sent 
specimens to Schinz. in any case, the majority of specimens on which these particular descriptions were 
based seem to be no longer extant, although some may yet show up in European collections. Many of Wied’s 
specimens evidently disappeared prior to the 1860 preparation of his handwritten “catalogue” at AMNh (a 
list not of specimens but of genera and species that were still represented in his collection).
6 it would seem only fair that such names should be attributed to “Wied in Schinz,” as was done for example 
by Wagler (1828: text for “Polychrus virescens Prinz von Neuwied in Schinz.”). But it is not explicitly dem-
onstrated within Schinz’s work itself that Wied supplied both the names and the descriptions as mandated 
in the authorship section of the Code (iCzN, 1999, art. 50.1).
7 on facing pages of german and latin texts, Merrem (1820: 65) misidentified and misspelled his “Eidechse 
borkische [sic]” as Lacerta striata. Merrem’s (1809: 2) “Die Borckische Eidechse” currently is known as the 
guayanan Kentropyx borckiana (Peters), because W. Peters (1869: 62) was the first to provide a latin binomen 
for the species (hoogmoed, 1973: 292–293).

After citing Merrem’s original description, gallagher and Dixon (1992: 137) said that “The meaning of 
‘Borckische’ has not been determined.” As made clear in the first paragraph of Merrem’s description, however, 
the name honors grafen (Count) von Borcke, whose collection supplied the specimen that was illustrated 
and described in detail (Merrem, 1809: 2–9, pl. 1 [reproduced herein as fig. 1]).

latin name Centropyx borckiana by Wilhelm Peters. hoogmoed (1973: 292–293) cleared up confusion 
associated with the name of this species, which currently is known as the guayanan Kentropyx borckiana 
(Peters, 1869). The dorsal surfaces probably were partially green in life, the blue color resulting from pres-
ervation in spirits. (hand-painted plate reproduced ×0.90 from Merrem, 1809, courtesy of harvard univer-

spelling “cyanomelas” does not appear on Schinz’s page 46, which contains the description (the 
corrected name is given in the errata). Known copies of Schinz’s Thierreich all have a spelling 
mistake on page 46. We are aware of the following three misspelled versions of the specific 
name: (1) “cyanomlas” is the most common version, appearing in copies of Das Thierreich in 
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the Museum of Comparative zoology, 
and in private copies owned by Kraig Adler and Rodrigues. (2) “cyanom  las”—with a variably 
sized blank space—is seen in copies in the Museum National d’histoire Naturelle (small space) 
and in the National Museum of Natural history, Smithsonian institution (large space). The 
blank space varies in size from about one to three letter spaces. (3) “cyanom” is a version 
known only in a copy of Schinz in the Natural history Museum in london. it was cited as a 
name “not mentioned elsewhere” by Vanzolini (1977a: 29), who has a xerographic copy of the 
British Museum book. The total of this variation can be explained by the supposition that the 
last three letters of “cyanomlas” had become loosened in the printing chase, gradually separat-
ing from “cyanom” and finally being lost altogether during printing. in support of this hypoth-
esis,  it  is  noted  that  species  names  in  Schinz  terminate  with  a  full  stop  (period),  which  is 
lacking in the truncated Lacerta “cyanom” version of the name.

The first misspelling is corrected on an unnumbered errata page (= p. 828) of the Thier-
reich: “Seite 46 zeile 8 lies cyanomelas statt cyanomlas.” The same correction appears in the 
British Museum copy, which has the spelling “cyanom” on page 46. Schinz’s correction to cya-
nomelas clearly determines the correct name, but, to be safe, as first revisers to have cited sev-
eral multiple spellings we naturally also select cyanomelas as correct (iCzN, 1999: art. 24.2.3).
The  name  Lacerta  cyanomelas  Schinz,  1822,  clearly  has  priority  over Teius  cyanomelas 
Wied, 1824 (1822–1831). The identity of this lizard, however, is best determined from the 
illustration and information published by Wied (see below under identity and Rediscovery of 
Teius cyanomelas Wied).

As an aside, it is not generally realized that Wied had unpublished manuscript names that 
he abandoned before publication (see under Lacerta vittata above, and Polychrus virescens and 
Scincus cyanurus below). Wied’s original name for cyanomelas was “Lacerta 5-lineata,” based 
on a specimen taken at Mucuri, April 20, 1816. Wied’s pen-and-watercolor field sketch, with 
name and data added by his hand, is reproduced in Bosch (1991: 237). it clearly is the sketch 
copied by Wied’s artist for publication in the Abbildungen as Teius cyanomelas (Wied, 1824 
[1822–1831]: lief. 5).

Agama picta: Agama picta Schinz, 1822, is the senior objective synonym of Agama picta 
Wied, 1823: lief. 3 (not “1825” auct.). Wied referenced Schinz by page number (without using 
the name) in his subsequent accounts of A. picta in Abbildungen letterpress and in the Beiträge. 
The taxon has been treated both as a species of Enyalius and as a subspecies of E. catenatus 
(Wied, 1821). Currently, Enyalius pictus is recognized as a full species living in the forests of 
coastal Brazil between the Jequitinhonha and Doce rivers (Rodrigues et al., 2006). The senior 
authorship of picta changes to Schinz, but the original concept of the taxon is that of Wied 
(1823, lief. 3; 1825: 125, 604).

AMERiCAN MuSEuM NoViTATES 

No. 3714

Polychrus virescens: This is similar to the situation with Lacerta vittata above, except that 
Wied did not mention Schinz (1822) in the Abbildungen or Beiträge synonymies. Wied instead 
explained in his Beiträge species account of Polychrus marmoratus that Schinz had used Poly-
chrus virescens based on a short note from him, but that P. virescens could no longer be kept 
(Wied, 1825: 124). unaware of these comments, Wagler (1828: pl. 12, text) illustrated a specimen 
of Polychrus marmoratus under the name “Polychrus virescens Prinz von Neuwied in Schinz.” 
Voigt (1832: 67) referenced P. virescens to Wagler (ibid.) rather than Schinz (1822). Schinz later 
(1833–1835: 88–89, pl. 28) reproduced Wagler’s color plate in reverse image and noted that 
“Sie ist nach Wied kaum verschieden von P. marmoratus und warscheinlich das Männchen 
[According to Wied it scarcely differs from P. marmoratus and is probably the male].”

in  letterpress  accompanying  the  Abbildungen  plate  Wied  noted  that  “Diese  bekannte 
Eidechse ist nirgends in ihren leibliche farben abgebildet [The living color of this well-known 
lizard has been nowhere described]” (Wied, 1829: lief. 13). he said in the Beiträge (Wied, 1825: 
123) that he had obtained only a single specimen alive, a female from Villa Viçoza. The prince’s 
pen-and-watercolor field sketch of this specimen and a copy of it (by the artist Beckers) for 
publication in the Abbildungen are reproduced in Bosch (1991: 243–244).

Polychrus virescens Schinz is correctly shown in Peters and Donoso-Barros (1970: 234) as 
a synonym of Polychrus marmoratus (linnaeus), but it had been Wied’s manuscript name for 
a new species that he subsequently re-identified as “Polychrus marmoratus, [sensu] Merrem.”
Scincus cyanurus: This was Wied’s manuscript name for a lizard that he later misidentified 
as “S[cinus]. quadrilineatus” (Wied, 1824: 664) and treated in detail as “Gymnophthalmus 
quadrilineatus Merr[em]” (Wied, 1825: 198; 1829: lief. 13). Lacerta quadrilineata is a linnaean 
name recognized as the nominal type species of Merrem’s (1820: 74) genus Gymnophthalmus. 
Wied, however, had a lizard not previously described. Wied’s description is clear and calls 
attention to the bright blue tail of the species (not shown in the Abbildungen plate because the 
sky-blue color disappears completely in preservative fide Wied, 1825: 203, 204). it is the only 
blue-tailed lizard living in an area traveled by Wied.

Reinhardt and lütken (“1861” [1862]: 211) honored the prince by naming Gymnophthal-
mus maximiliani based on new material and the unavailable name “Gymnophthalmus quadri-
lineatus Wied.” Boulenger (1885: 426) referred both these names to the then recently erected 
genus Micrablepharus Boettger, 1885;8 Boulenger also placed the nominal type species of Micra-
blepharus (M. glaucurus Boettger) as a synonym of M. maximiliani.

Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822, is an overlooked senior synonym of Micrablepharus maxi-
miliani (Reinhardt and lütken “1861” [1862]), which is a well-known name worthy of saving 
(see under Protection of Three Junior Synonyms). it is fortunate that Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 
1822, can be qualified below as a nomen oblitum, inasmuch as it also is a senior homonym of 
a well-known Pacific skink (Scincus cyanurus lesson, 1826 = Emoia cyanura; see ineich and 
zug, 1991, for literature).

8 Authorship of Boettger’s Micrablepharus is mistakenly attributed to “Dunn, 1932” in recent gymnophthalmid 
classifications (Pellegrino et al., 2001: 330; Castoe et al., 2004: 465).

Buf[o] cinctus: Bufo cinctus Schinz, 1822, is the senior synonym of Bufo cinctus Wied, 
1823. Wied gave the page reference to Schinz (1822: 177) in the Abbildungen letterpress text 
accompanying his Bufo cinctus plate (Wied, 1823: lief. 3) and in his species account in the 
Beiträge (Wied, 1825: 564). The name Bufo cinctus has long been in the synonymy of Bufo cru-
cifer Wied, 1821 (= Chaunus crucifer fide frost et al., 2006: 364).

The Rediscovery and identity of Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824

history of the Name: Among the many new animals discovered and described by Wied 
was Teius cyanomelas, which was illustrated in a color plate in the fifth issue of the Abbildungen 
(Wied, 1824 [1822–1831]: lief. 5, fig. 2 of composite pl.). This lizard was accurately figured and 
had a precise type locality (open areas around the mouth of Rio Mucuri in state of Bahia, Bra-
zil), and was given a detailed description in the Beiträge (Wied, 1825: 180–185). Nonetheless, 
it was never properly recognized. Bocourt (1874: 251, footnote 1), without justification, refer-
enced it as Ameiva cyanomelas, but considered Wied’s illustration and description both inade-
quate for a proper allocation of the species, suggesting that it was close to Ameiva festiva, A. 
edracantha, and A. septemlineata, or possibly a synonym of Cnemidophorus lemniscatus. Bou-
lenger (1885: 363) placed Teius cyanomelas with a question mark in the synonymy of Cnemi-
dophorus lemniscatus, an allocation followed by most subsequent authors. Burt (1931: 32), in 
a major revision of Cnemidophorus, thought that Bocourt’s suggestion that cyanomelas might 
be a synonym of C. lemniscatus “rather far fetched, since the photograph [sic] shows only two 
distinct light lines on each side, and a single middorsal line,” but Burt considered Ameiva to 
be probably the right genus. Peters and Donoso-Barros’ (1970: 94) influential catalog followed 
Boulenger in keeping T. cyanomelas with a question mark in the synonymy of Cnemidophorus 
lemniscatus, although cyanomelas was erroneously dated from the 1825 Beiträge.

it is understandable that cyanomelas was attributed to Cnemidophorus by most authors 
from Boulenger on, but its continued association with C. lemniscatus was unwarranted because 
lemniscatus sensu lato occurs from Central America to Amazonia where Wied, a fine zoologist 
who precisely identified his localities, never collected.

Vanzolini (1996: 214), however, recognized the problem and considered cyanomelas to be 
an unrecognized species of Cnemidophorus. Except for Amazonian forms, Cnemidophori from 
tropical South America have been attributed to the ocellifer group—a multispecies complex 
(Rodrigues, 1987: 224), including new species recently described (Dias et al., 2002; feltrim and

taxonomic revision of the group is needed.

Rediscovery and Taxonomic Conclusion: Recently, during a field trip to obtain speci-
mens of Cnemidophorus along the Atlantic coast of Brazil for an ongoing molecular and karyo-
typic study, Rodrigues’ group collected several specimens of Cnemidophorus nativo. This is a 
parthenogenetic species of the ocellifer group recently described from Reserva florestal da 
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, municipality of linhares, state of Espirito Santo (Rocha et al., 
1997). The specific name (nativo) was given in reference to its habitat, the open shrubby areas

fig. 2.  Cnemidophorus nativo Rocha et al., 1997, a Brazilian lizard discovered in 1818 by Prince Maximilian 
zu Wied. The earlier names Lacerta cyanomelas Schinz, 1822, and Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–1831) 
are qualified herein as forgotten names (nomina oblita), whereas Cnemidophorus nativo is qualified as a pro-
tected name (nomen protectum). Top: The original Abbildungen illustration of Teius cyanomelas Wied, repro-
duced ×1.38 from a composite plate (Wied, 1824 [1822–1831], lief. 5). The plate was prepared from an artist’s 
copy of Wied’s pen-and-watercolor field sketch, in which the background was a horizontal line. The accom-
panying letterpress text includes “Rücken schwarz, mit einem breiten bläulichen längsstreif in der Mitte, und 
zwei weißbläulichen schmäleren an der Seite [Back black, with a wide bluish median stripe, and two narrower 
bluish white lateral stripes].” Bottom: A specimen of Cnemidophorus nativo from Restinga do Barra Seca, 
linhares, state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The extent of color variation is unknown, but Rocha et al. (1997: 378) 
wrote that the median “light salmon stripe . . . continues mostly as light grey and/or light blue [emphasis 
added] along the dorsal region of tail” and “vivid white” lateral stripes.

near the coast (“campo nativo”) where it occurs. The species is fairly abundant in open habitats 
near the eastern coast of Brazil from Regência in the state of Espirito Santo (our records), to 
Camamú in the state of Bahia (Vrcibradic et al., 2002). it is the only species of Cnemidophorus 
present in this long stretch of approximately 700 km (Rocha, 2000); it is considered “vulnera-
ble” in the list of endangered Brazilian species (iBAMA, 2008; Rodrigues, 2005). The striking 
color pattern of living specimens and the apparent absence of other Cnemidophorus in the 
range of C. nativo caused us to revisit Wied’s figure and description of Teius cyanomelas. The 
type localities of T. cyanomelas and C. nativo are only about 100 km apart and our comparisons 
of fresh material of nativo with Wied’s figure and detailed description correspond so closely 
that we conclude that a single species is involved (see fig. 2).

As already noted, the name Lacerta cyanomelas Schinz, 1822, has priority over Teius cya-
nomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–1831). Even Schinz’s (1822: 46) second-hand 10-line description 
permits a fairly good identification of this species of Cnemidophorus. The smooth ventral scales, 
disposed in six longitudinal rows, granular dorsals, color pattern (especially the undulating 
borders of the middorsal stripe) and size referred to by Schinz are sufficient to identify the 
species. Although Wied’s only specimen had a broken tail (see fig. 2), both Schinz (1822: 46) 
and Wied (1825: 180) diagnosed the species as having a long tail, but that was an accurate 
extrapolation; Wied (ibid.: 181), with his usual attention to detail, explained that the broken 
tail was “scheinbar viel länger als der Körper [seemingly much longer than the body].”

Wied’s unique specimen of Teius cyanomelas was not in the collection purchased by the 
American Museum. Nevertheless, it seems evident that Lacerta cyanomelas Schinz, 1822, and 
Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–1831) are senior names for Cnemidophorus nativo Rocha 
et al., 1997. The last name has become well-enough known to receive protected status under 
iCzN criteria.

Protection of Three Junior Synonyms

The Principle of Priority is a cornerstone of zoological nomenclature. Some taxonomists 
may advocate rather strict adherence to this principle, believing that the oldest available name 
of a taxon should be nearly always the one used. Nonetheless, it seems a disservice to other 
biologists and the public when old, unused names are dredged up to replace names currently 
applied to well-known animals. Precedence of a younger name over an older one sometimes 
can be gained by the cumbersome route of petitioning the international Commission on zoo-
logical Nomenclature. if the taxa are rarely mentioned, this strategy is likely to be unsuccessful 
and therefore not worth the effort; it almost certainly will fail if only the authorship of a rarely 
used name is changed, as in the case of Enyalius pictus (Wied, 1823)—now Enyalius pictus 
(Schinz, 1822).

Article 23.9 of the latest Code (iCzN, 1999), however, provides a procedure for saving 
well-known junior names without formal petition. We use that method to qualify the names 
of the following three species as protected names (nomina protecta).

Kentropyx calcarata Spix, 1825

As explained above, the description of Lacerta vittata Schinz, 1822, was based on a manu-
script name transmitted by Wied to Schinz, who validated the name. hoogmoed (1973: 301) 
pointed out that Lacerta vittata Schinz, 1822, was a senior synonym of Kentropyx calcarata and 
indicated intent to propose suppression by the iCzN. Although the proposal was not submit-
ted, other authors (especially gallagher and Dixon, 1992: 141–142, and Ávila-Pires, 1995: 524) 
accepted the synonymy but followed hoogmoed’s lead in continuing use of the junior name.
To our knowledge, the name Lacerta vittata Schinz has not been used as a valid name since 
its publication and specifically “has not been used as a valid name after 1899” (iCzN, 1999: 
art. 23.9.1.1). The junior name Kentropyx calcarata Spix, 1825, has been used as a “presumed 
valid name, in at least 25 works, published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 
50 years and encompassing a span of not less than 10 years” (iCzN, 1999: art. 23.9.1.2).

The following 25 references (among many available) meet the criteria quoted above: Ávila 
and Silva, 2009; Ávila-Pires, 1995, 2005; Ávila-Pires et al., 2009; Castoe et al., 2004; Cole et al., 
1995; Cosson et al., 1999; gallagher and Dixon, 1980, 1992; gallagher et al., 1986; gasnier et 
al., 1994; hoogmoed, 1973, 1979; hoogmoed and lescure, 1975; lima et al., 2001; MacCulloch

et al., 2002; Ribeiro-Júnior et al., 2006; Smith and Ballinger, 2001; Telford and Telford, 2003; 
Werneck et al., 2009; Vitt, 1991a.

Kentropyx calcarata Spix, 1825, the younger but valid name for the species, is here desig-
nated as a nomen protectum. it has precedence over the senior name Lacerta vittata Schinz, 
1822, which is here qualified as a nomen oblitum, and over the unavailable name Lacerta striata 
sensu Wied, 1825 (non Daudin nec sensu Merrem), which was a misidentification in the sense 
of the Code (iCzN 1999: art. 49).

Micrablepharus maximiliani (Reinhardt and lütken, “1861” [1862])

As explained above, Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822, is the senior name (Wied’s “Gymnoph-
thalmus quadrilineatus” was a misidentification). To our knowledge, Scincus cyanurus Schinz 
“has not been used as a valid name after 1899” (iCzN, 1999: art. 23.9.1.1). The junior name Gym-
nophthalmus maximiliani Reinhardt and lütken, “1861” [1862]—known since 1885 as Micra-
blepharus maximiliani (Reinhardt and lütken, “1861” [1862])—has been used as a “presumed 
valid name, in at least 25 works, published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 
50 years and encompassing a span of not less than 10 years” (iCzN, 1999: art. 23.9.1.2).

The following 25 references meet the criteria quoted above: Ávila-Pires, 1995; Castoe et al.,

Micrablepharus maximiliani (Reinhardt and lütken, “1861” [1862]), the younger but valid 
name for the species, is here designated as a nomen protectum. it has precedence over the senior 
name Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822, which is here qualified as a nomen oblitum, and over the 
unavailable name Gymnophthalmus quadrilineatus sensu Wied, 1825 (non linnaeus nec sensu 
Merrem), which was a misidentification in the sense of the Code (iCzN 1999: art. 49).

Qualifying Scincus cyanurus Schinz, 1822, as a nomen oblitum also solves the problem of 
homonymy with the later-named Scincus cyanurus lesson, 1826—a wide-spread Pacific skink 
currently known as Emoia cyanura (lesson) (see p. 8).

Cnemidophorus nativo Rocha et al., 1997

As noted above, Lacerta cyanomelas Schinz, 1822, and Teius cyanomelas Wied, 1824 (1822–
1831) are senior names. To our knowledge, neither has “been used as a valid name after 1899” 
(iCzN, 1999: art. 23.9.1.1). The junior name Cnemidophorus nativo Rocha et al., 1997, has been 
used as a “presumed valid name, in at least 25 works, published by at least 10 authors in the 
immediately preceding 50 years and encompassing a span of not less than 10 years” (iCzN, 
1999: art. 23.9.1.2).
