The detailed osteological treatment presented here establishes that these fossils are virtually indistinguishable from the species Camelops hesternus, a common member of Blancan to Rancholabrean faunas and known best from temperate regions of western North America. Metrically, high-latitude members of C. hesternus seem to have been smaller bodied than representatives from more southerly parts of the species range, a finding that is consistent with body-mass differences among populations of other large mammals whose ranges extended into the far north. The presence of C. hesternus in Alaska and Yukon was likely episodic, limited to relatively warm intervals such as the Last Interglaciation (Sangamonian).',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Comparative data from the ear region has played an important role in recent combined-data phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of living and extinct Artiodactyla and the position of that clade among Euungulata. These studies have also been important for establishing the phylogenetic position of Cetacea and for understanding the relationships of a diversity of euungulate species to their fossil relatives. Detailed and standardized descriptive reference works of the basicranium for a range of living artiodactylans are not, however, readily available. Here I describe exemplar species from the four major extant terrestrial and semiaquatic artiodactylan clades (Hippopotamidae, Ruminantia, Suina, and Camelidae) and illustrate the anatomy of the ear region with the auditory bulla both in place and removed. Terrestrial artiodactyls exhibit varying degrees of expansion of the bony external acoustic meatus laterally relative to the mediolateral dimensions of the rounded, medial aspect of the auditory bulla, a characteristic that is least developed in Tragulidae. A relatively elongate external acoustic meatus has previously been described as entirely absent in living and fossil cetaceans and in some fossil species such as Diacodexis pakistanensis. Variation also exists in the proximity of the petrosal-bullar complex to midline basicranial bones. Isolation of these bones from other basicranial structures has been previously interpreted as functionally important for underwater hearing in Cetacea. Many artiodactylans have contact between the auditory bulla and the basioccipital but no contact between the deeper pars cochlearis of the petrosal bone and the basioccipital/basisphenoid. Exceptions are species of Hippopotamidae in which both the bulla and the petrosal are separated from midline bones. The functional interpretation of this separation has previously been linked to aquatic hearing, but this association may be more complex than originally thought. Other features observed in the basicrania of terrestrial artiodactylans described here are a general coalescence of basicranial foramina (i.e., the basicapsular fissure, carotid foramen, piriform fenestra, and sometimes the foramen ovale), the development of large and ornate styliform processes in species of Ruminantia, and widespread contact between the auditory bulla and the paracondylar process of the exoccipital.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'All 16 species of the family Eremochaetidae occur from the late Jurassic to the mid-Cretaceous of eastern and Central Asia. The first species in amber, and the latest occurrence of the family, was recently described as Zhenia xiai, from the mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar, ca. 100 Ma. New observations of a finely preserved specimen allow refinement of the morphological interpretations in the original description. The female of Zhenia, for example, has the distinctive piercing oviscapt of the superfamily Archisargoidea, formed from modified cerci (not tergites 8 and 9 as originally reported). The pretarsus of Zhenia bears an enormous empodial pad and pair of pulvillae, but the claws are highly vestigial (contra Zhang et al., 2016). The fly was almost certainly a parasitoid. A cladistic analysis of 26 binary-state characters and six continuously variable characters, using 47 exemplar Archisargoidea species from most genera and all four families, and five outgroup Brachycera, has very poor support for most clades but confirms the position of Zhenia in Eremochaetidae. Evidence on the relationships of Archisargoidea to other Brachycera is reviewed, and a close relationship to the Nemestrinoidea or Muscomorpha is best supported. A catalog of the species and some higher taxa of Archisargoidea is provided.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'A remarkable diversity of new nonempidoid orthorrhaphan flies from the mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar (late Albian-early Cenomanian, ca. 99 Ma) is presented, including 28 species (all but one new) in 22 genera (13 new), and at least 12 families. Two families are new; three genera are unplaced in Tabanomorpha and one unplaced within Brachycera. Comparisons are presented between the amber taxa and extensive lithified taxa from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of eastern Laurasia. In Stratiomyomorpha: A new species of Zhangsolvidae has color patterns and body shape that apparently mimic Vespidae or other stinging aculeate wasps. Diverse new Xylomyidae and Stratiomyidae are described, the latter with male terminalia preserved in detail. In Tabanomorpha: The genus Athericites Mostovski et al. is synonymized with Palaepangonius Ren, and a new species of Galloatherix Nel is described in which the female proboscis is much longer than that of the male. All three genera were attributed to Athericidae, but the amber species reveal they are more basal tabanomorphs. Described are a new genus of stem-group Tabanoidea and a new species of Cratotabanus Martins-Neto and Kucero-Santos (Tabanidae), previously known from the Cretaceous of Brazil and New Jersey. In Nemestrinoidea: Three species of Hirmoneura Meigen are the first Nemestrinidae known from amber; one species has long cerci typical of Recent species of the genus. A new species of the Mesozoic family Rhagionemestriidae reveals this family is closely related to Acroceridae, not Xylophagidae as previously proposed. In Archisargoidea: A new species of Tethepomyiidae is described, the family known only in Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, Spain, and Myanmar. In Asiloidea: Three new species and genera of Bombyliidae are described, two of them with abdominal setal \"baskets\" distinctive to females of higher bombyliids. A fourth new asiloid genus is a probable stem-group bombyliid. The recently described Pseudorhagio Zhang et al., is transferred from Tabanomorpha to Bombyliidae. The male of a new species of Burmapsilocephala Gaimari and Mostovski (Apsilocephalidae) has terminalia very similar to that of Evocoa (Evocoidae: Recent, Chile), corroborating close relationship of the two families. In Families incertae sedis: A new species of Hilarimorphites Grimaldi and Cumming (Apystomyiidae) is described, the family known only in New Jersey and Burmese amber and the Recent fauna of California, and a sister group to either Cyclorrhapha or Eremoneura. Mysteromyiidae and Eucaudomyiidae, new families, are described, based on highly modified species with vestigial mouthparts, reduced venation, and unique specializations. Discussion is presented on some morphological features in fossil and Recent Brachycera that have apparent phylogenetic significance but are rarely discussed. This study adds further data to the phenotypic diversity, geological history, and biogeography of a major radiation.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u\"The purpose of this study is to describe the mature larvae of all taxa of the tribe Osmiini (Megachilidae) whose postdefecating larvae have been collected and are available. The hope is that data uncovered will eventually lead to a better understanding of the interrelationships of included taxa and of their anatomies, behaviors, and ecologies (i.e., their natural histories). The species included are representatives of the following taxa: Ashmeadiella, Atoposmia, Chelostoma, Heriades, Hoplitis, and Osmia (Hoplosmia). We also include recently described larval representatives of Haetosmia and Ochreriades. Because of its large size and diversity, the genus Osmia alone (with the exception of the subgenus Hoplosmia) is allocated to a separate future investigation. Larvae of the tribe share many features with one another and also with other members of the Megachilidae. Anatomical structures of larval Osmiini whereby they can be differentiated from other megachilids were not identified. However, most (though not all) members of the tribe fall into one of three main subgroups on the basis of: (1) body form, (2) presence or absence of middorsal, intersegmental tubercles on basal abdominal segments 1-5, and (3) the depth of intersegmental constrictions. In the process of gathering specimens the authors uncovered new information concerning nesting biology with respect to nest location and structure and to cocoon structure and function. These data were derived from the authors' own field studies as well as from specimens and field data collected through the years by others.\",\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'The scorpion fauna of East Africa, encompassing Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda, is more diverse than those of West and Central Africa, but a systematic survey has never been conducted and the distributions of its species remain poorly understood. A recent opportunity to examine two extensive collections of East African, and predominantly Kenyan, scorpions and new material acquired by the author permitted a reassessment of the fauna of the region. The present contribution, the first of several emanating from this research, comprises two parts. The first part presents a redefinition and revision of the scorpionid genus Pandinoides Fet, 1997, with a redescription of the type species, Pandinoides cavimanus (Pocock, 1888), a revalidation and redescription of Pandinoides militaris (Pocock, 1900), and a description of Pandinoides duffmackayi, sp. nov. Pending reassessment of the genera and subgenera of Pandinus, sensu lato, based on quantitative phylogenetic analysis, Pandinoides is restricted to the three species with a marked concave depression in the retrodorsal surface of the pedipalp chela manus of the adult male, and Pandinus platycheles Werner, 1916, transferred to Pandinus subgenus Pandinoriens Rossi, 2015, creating a new combination: Pandinus (Pandinoriens) platycheles (Werner, 1916), comb. nov. The availability of large series comprising both sexes and all stages of the three Pandinoides species covered herein revealed considerable variation in counts of pedipalp trichobothria, spiniform macrosetae of the leg telotarsi, and pectinal teeth, among and even within individual conspecifics, calling into question the widespread practice of defining species and supraspecific taxa almost exclusively on trivial meristic differences between small samples of material (often singletons, female or immature). Furthermore, whereas neobothriotaxic patterns with low counts may provide appropriate diagnostic characters for genera and species, in combination with other characters, this is generally inadvisable when trichobothrial counts are high, due to the greater instability of the patterns. The second part of this contribution assesses the validity of several putative species of Pandinus, sensu lato, recently described or revalidated, in light of data presented in the first part, and presents 10 new synonyms: Heterometrus roeseli Simon, 1872 = Pandinus (P.) imperator (C.L. Koch, 1841), syn. nov.; Pandinus (P.) camerounensis Louren\\xe7o, 2014 = Pandinus (P.) imperator (C.L.

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Entomobryomorphan springtails (Hexapoda: Entognatha: Collembola) of the family Isotomidae are the most numerous group of Collembola in Spanish amber, a pattern typical in other studied Cretaceous amber deposits. Here we provide a revision of the Spanish amber springtail fauna, early Cretaceous (late Albian) in age, based on 93 specimens sufficiently well preserved to permit specific identification. Three new species are erected within the Isotomidae: Anurophorinae. These are: Burmisotoma spinulifera, new species, Protoisotoma autrigoniensis, new species, and Proisotoma communis, new species. The two former are respectively placed in the Cretaceous genera Burmisotoma Christiansen and Nascimbene (previously known from Cenomanian Burmese amber) and Protoisotoma Christiansen and Pike (in both Burmese and Canadian ambers), while the last species is indistinguishable from the extant, cosmopolitan genus Proisotoma B\\xf6rner (also recorded in Burmese amber). Low morphological intraspecific variability is described for P. communis. Taxa are discussed in relation to other fossil entomobryomorphan lineages as well as their modern counterparts. A catalog of the known fossil springtails is appended. Isotomidae are diverse springtails, putatively basal among Entomobryomorpha and extending back into the early Devonian. Indeed, taxa described herein are overall remarkably similar to their extant relatives, emphasizing the antiquity and morphological stasis of the group as a whole.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Fossil remains of Paleogene Palaeognathae are poorly documented and are exceedingly rare. One group of palaeognaths, the lithornithids, is well represented in the Paleogene of North America. Nevertheless, few specimens of the same species are known from each of those Paleogene geologic units. Here, we report five new partial skeletons of lithornithids from the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation (early Eocene) of Wyoming. One spectacularly preserved specimen is identified as the holotype of a new species, Calciavis grandei, gen. et sp. nov., and fully described. Preserved soft tissues (e.g., feathers, pes scales) surround the nearly articulated and complete skeleton. A second well-preserved but disarticulated skeleton is referred to this new taxon. We conclude that there are only two lithornithid taxa in the Green River Formation after careful comparisons with the other known taxon from the same geological unit, Pseudocrypturus cercanaxius. Morphological data generated from the new taxon and other Green River Formation lithornithid specimens were integrated into a osteology-only phylogenetic data set containing stem avians as outgroups and extinct and extant members of Palaeognathae (Tinamidae, ratites) and Neognathaes (Anseriformes, Galliformes, Neoaves), unnamed lithornithid specimens, and the following named lithornithid taxa: Lithornis plebius, Lithornis promiscuus, Lithornis celetius, Paracathartes howardae. We find a monophyletic Lithornithidae (containing Calciavis grandei, Pseudocrypturus cercanaxius, Lithornis plebius, Lithornis promiscuus, Lithornis celetius, Paracathartes howardae) as the sister taxon of Tinamidae at the base of Palaeognathae and also recover a monophyletic Ratitae in the morphology-only analysis. A Lithornithidae-Tinamidae relationship, which could imply a broad Northern Hemisphere distribution in the Paleogene for this total group retracted to the present day Neotropical distribution after the Eocene, is weakly supported in our analysis and is also supported by other lines of evidence such as eggshell morphology. Relationships among flightless palaeognaths and assessment of character homology in this group remain problematic. Indeed, when the morphological analyses were constrained to enforce topologies recovered from all recent analyses of molecular sequence data and retroelement insertions, Lithornithidae is no longer recovered with Tinamidae, which is nested within the now paraphyletic ratites, but remains at the base of Palaeognathae. Thus, regardless of the position of Tinamidae, Lithornithidae is recovered at the base of the clade. However, evidence that many, if not all, of these \"ratite\" lineages independently evolved similar morphologies related to large size and flight loss suggests that the proposed position of the Lithornithidae remains tentative. Significant morphological variation within Lithornithidae should be captured in inclusive future analyses through use of species terminals.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'The Huayquer\\xedas Formation (late Miocene, Huayquerian SALMA) is broadly exposed in west-central Argentina (Mendoza). The target of several major paleontological expeditions in the first half of the 20th century, the Mendozan Huayquer\\xedas (\"badlands\") have recently yielded a significant number of new fossil finds. In this contribution we describe a complete skull (IANIGLA-PV 29) and place it systematically as Huayqueriana cf. H. cristata (Rovereto, 1914) (Litopterna, Macraucheniidae). The specimen shares some nonexclusive features with H. cristata (similar size, rostral border of the orbit almost level with distal border of M3, convergence of maxillary bones at the level of the P3/P4 embrasure, flat snout, very protruding orbits, round outline of premaxillary area in palatal view, and small diastemata between I3/C and C/P1). Other differences (e.g., lack of sagittal crest) may or may not represent intraspecific variation. In addition to other features described here, endocast reconstruction utilizing computer tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a derived position of the orbitotemporal canal running below the rhinal fissure along the lateroventral aspect of the piriform lobe. CT scanning also established that the maxillary nerve (CN V\\u2082) leaves the skull through the sphenoorbital fissure, as in all other litopterns, a point previously contested for macraucheniids. The angle between the lateral semicircular canal and the plane of the base of the skull is about 26\\xb0, indicating that in life the head was oriented much as in modern horses. Depending on the variables used, estimates of the body mass of IANIGLA-PV 29 produced somewhat conflicting results. Our preferred body mass estimate is 250 kg, based on the centroid size of 36 3D cranial landmarks and accompanying low prediction error. The advanced degree of tooth wear in IANIGLA-PV 29 implies that the individual died well into old age. However, a count of cementum lines on the sectioned left M2 is consistent with an age at death of 10 or 11 years, younger than expected given its body mass. This suggests that the animal had a very abrasive diet. Phylogenetic analysis failed to resolve the position of IANIGLA-PV 29 satisfactorily, a result possibly influenced by intraspecific variation. There is no decisive evidence for the proposition that Huayqueriana, or any other litoptern, were foregut fermenters.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Species in the Drosophila bromeliae group visit flowers, where most or all of the species probably breed. They are not collected in significant numbers. The group has thus far included five Neotropical species: aguape Val and Marques, 1996 (from southern Brazil), bromeliae Sturtevant, 1921 (Cuba), bromelioides Pavan and Cunha, 1947 (Brazil), florae Sturtevant, 1921 (type locality Cuba, also reported from the Caribbean and Central Ameria), and speciose Silva and Martins, 2004 (northern Brazil). Based on specimens from various museums, collections by the author, and detailed study of some types, the following revisions are made to the group: Drosophila florae is known only on the basis of the holotype female from Cuba, and bromeliae is widespread throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America; both species are redescribed in detail. Nine new species are described: Drosophila billheedi, n. sp. (from Trinidad); D. manni, n. sp. (Bolivia); D. mexiflora, n. sp. (Mexico, possibly Jamaica); D. paramanni, n. sp. (Costa Rica); D. penispina, n. sp. (Dominican Republic and Costa Rica); D. sevensteri, n. sp. (Panama); D. starki, n. sp. (Dominican Republic); D. stylipennis, n. sp. (Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico); and D. thurstoni, n. sp. (Jamaica). Four additional species are reported but not described since they are based just on females. Brazilian/Amazonian species will be treated separately. Intra- and interspecific geographic variation is documented in widespread species, the immature stages of Drosophila bromeliae are described in detail, and a key to species based on adult males is provided to facilitate identification of these very similar species.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'In this report, the first installment of a comprehensive revision of the didelphid marsupial genus Marmosops, we revise the species of the subgenus Sciophanes. Based on morphological character variation among almost 300 examined specimens--which we interpret in the context of a previously published analysis of molecular sequence data--this revision recognizes 12 valid species in three monophyletic species groups: the Parvidens Group (including M. pakaraimae, M. parvidens, and M. pinheiroi), the Fuscatus Group (M. carri, M. fuscatus, M. handleyi, and M. invictus), and the Bishopi Group (M. bishopi, M. juninensis, M. ojastii, and two new species). For each species we summarize information about type material, ecogeographic distribution, and diagnostic morphological characters. Despite our diligent search for relevant material in North and South American museums, the absence of any specimens of Sciophanes from vast Amazonian and Andean landscapes with seemingly suitable habitat suggests that significant range extensions and/or new species will result from future inventory fieldwork.',\n",

The genus is characterized by the supraclypeal and supraantennal areas covered by distinct, uniformly spaced striae; antenna without white band; foretibia distinctly swollen, fusiform; forewing with extensive fuscous bands; areolet large, pentagonal, longer than wide, distinctly convergent; spiracle of first metasomal tergite placed at midlength; and ventral valve of ovipositor apically dilated and overlapping dorsal valve as a lobe. The type species, N. ornatipennis (Cresson) is redescribed, illustrated, and newly recorded from the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. A new species, N. laluzbrillante, sp. nov., is described from the Dominican Republic. It is diagnosed mainly by having mesopleuron, propodeum, and metasoma extensively marked with blackish and whitish stripes and spots; clypeus in front view with base almost as wide as apex; central ocellus about as large as lateral ones; epicnemial carina short, reaching only 0.4 of length to subalar ridge; and areolet crossveins 2r-m and 3r-m distinctly convergent, but far from meeting on anterior apex of areolet.

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'A new fossil from the late Eocene BQ-2 locality in the Birket Qarun Formation in the Fayum Depression of northern Egypt (dated to ~37 mybp) does not fit within the diagnosis of any previously described family of bats from Africa or any other continent. Known from a partial maxilla, this taxon has dilambdodont tribosphenic molars with a well-developed, symmetrical, W-shaped ectoloph lacking a distinct mesostyle but with a strong parastyle and shallow U-shaped ectoflexus--all traits that are found in most archaic bat families and that are probably plesiomorphic for bats. However, this taxon also has an M2 with a large metaconule cusp and a large, bulbous hypocone set low on the posterolingual corner of the tooth, neither of which occur in any known bat family, living or extinct. Also notable is the size of the new BQ-2 bat, which appears to have been approximately the same size as the largest extant bats with dilambdodont dentitions, falling well within the size range of plant-eating megabats and carnivorous bats from several extant lineages. The combination of traits in the new BQ-2 bat suggests that it was omnivorous, probably including insects, small vertebrates, and plant material [in] its diet. In this regard it represents an ecological niche previously unknown among archaic Eocene bats, which are otherwise thought to have been strictly animalivorous. Because extinct Eocene bat families exhibit considerable mosaic evolution in morphological traits, do not seem to have inhabited a uniform ecological niche, and do not form a monophyletic group, we argue against use of the name \"Eochiroptera\" to collectively refer to these taxa.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u\"Madagascar is one of the world's most recognized biodiversity hotspots and has a diverse assassin bug (Reduviidae) fauna that is still incompletely known, especially for the Ectrichodiinae, or millipede assassin bugs. Ectrichodiinae are a speciose (673 described species, 118 genera), worldwide group of assassin bugs that is most diverse in the Old and New World tropics, but so far only six genera and 10 species have been described from Madagascar. Based on examination of 1981 ectrichodiine specimens mostly from the California Academy of Sciences, as well as a few other collections, dramatic undescribed species-level diversity is revealed. The island's Ectrichodiinae fauna is taxonomically revised with the description of three new genera (Marojejycoris, Tanindrazanus, and Toliarus) and 63 new species: Gibbosella andasibe, Gibbosella betampona, Gibbosella brunalvus, Gibbosella conisimilis, Gibbosella fulva, Gibbosella mantella, Gibbosella megafrons, Gibbosella nitida, Gibbosella notoconica, Gibbosella pallidacorium, Gibbosella pallidalata, Gibbosella planiscutum, Gibbosella quadocris, Gibbosella vangocris, Glymmatophora (Glymmatophora) carolae, Marojejycoris auranticorium, Marojejycoris brevifrons, Marojejycoris francais, Marojejycoris notadichroa, Marojejycoris ranomafana, Tanindrazanus amboasaricus, Tanindrazanus andohahela, Tanindrazanus anjozorobeus, Tanindrazanus antananarivo, Tanindrazanus bemaraha, Tanindrazanus brunneus, Tanindrazanus hannajagodae, Tanindrazanus harinhali, Tanindrazanus irwini, Tanindrazanus joffrevillus, Tanindrazanus kathrynae, Tanindrazanus mahafaly, Tanindrazanus marginatus, Tanindrazanus marojejy, Tanindrazanus nigripes, Tanindrazanus notatus, Tanindrazanus simulans, Tanindrazanus tenebricus, Tanindrazanus varicolor, Tanindrazanus vohiparara, Toliarus karinae, Toliarus trichrous, Toxopus ambohitantely, Toxopus ampitavananima, Toxopus antsiranana, Toxopus basalis, Toxopus brucei, Toxopus farafangana, Toxopus fisheri, Toxopus griswoldi, Toxopus insignis, Toxopus italaviana, Toxopus melobrunneus, Toxopus miandritsara, Toxopus namoroka, Toxopus pallidus, Toxopus parkeri, Toxopus simulans, Toxopus steineri, Toxopus tibialis, Toxopus toamasina, Toxopus toliara, and Toxopus vazimba. Toxopus Bergroth, 1905, is redescribed, with the first description of males in the genus, and Cleptria signoretii Reuter, 1887, is transferred to Toxopus. Gibbosella Ch\\u0142ond, 2010, is also redescribed and includes description of males for the first time. Gibbosella elongata Ch\\u0142ond, 2010, Glymmatophora crassipes Horv\\xe1th, 1914, and Maraenaspis bidens (Reuter), 1887, are redescribed, with the first description of males for each species. Habitus images, documentation of male and female genitalic features, identification keys, and distribution maps are provided. Males and females are associated based on morphology, geographic information, and, when available, molecular data. The newly discovered species diversity constitutes a sixfold increase over the previously documented millipede assassin bug fauna in Madagascar.\",\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'This paper reports on a large nesting site of the ground-nesting solitary bee Hesperapis (Carinapis) rhodocerata (Cockerell) from southern New Mexico first discovered in the late summer of 2010 and active again in late summer 2015. Because the site was visited annually during intervening years without observation of any specimens, the species is believed to sustain a multiyear diapause that is broken in response to rain. It is judged to be univoltine, and females at the site collect pollen from Heterotheca (Asteraceae). Nests are briefly described as are the nest-digging behavior and pollen-transport system of females. The feeding behavior of larvae involves grazing on the surface of the food sphere, thus reducing its diameter. This is accomplished with the aid of paired ventral tubercles on each of the three thoracic and first eight abdominal segments and a single median ventral tubercle on the ninth abdominal segment. The second and last larval instars are described and illustrated. The first instar is essentially identical to the second instar except for size. Mature larvae are similar to other known Hesperapis larvae. The strongly curved egg of H. rhodocerata is described and illustrated with a diagram and SEM micrographs of the micropyle. Because the last larval instar does not spin a cocoon and freshly constructed brood cells are unlined by females, questions are evoked concerning humidity control and parasite exclusion during the long diapause of mature larvae. This information is compared with and found in some ways different from that uncovered in an earlier study of H. (Amblyapis) larreae Cockerell. It is hypothesized that the clear thin transparent material covering the postdefecating larva of H. rhodocerata may function to inhibit desiccation and furthermore may be the same material that hardens and waterproofs the cell walls of other congeneric species including H. larreae, thereby serving a similar function but in a different way. Because too few mature larvae of H. larreae had been collected at the time of drafting the study of that species, their description is added here as an addendum.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'A new genus and species of bethylid wasps is described and figured from a female preserved in early Cretaceous (Barremian) amber from Lebanon. Holopsenella primotica, new genus and species, is distinguished from other bethylids and segregated into a new subfamily, Holopsenellinae, along with Cretabythus sibiricus Evans in late Cretaceous (Santonian) Taimyrian amber. Holopsenellines are perhaps basal within the family, representing a stem group to other Bethylidae, and, if so, those features shared with the coeval Lancepyrinae suggest a basal position for that lineage as well. In addition, Lancepyris alavaensis Ortega-Blanco and Engel in early Cretaceous (Albian) amber from northern Spain is considered generically distinct from the type species of the genus, L. opertus Azevedo and Azar in Lebanese amber, and is transferred to the new genus, Zophepyris, resulting in the new combination, Zophepyris alavaensis (Ortega-Blanco and Engel). The genus Archaepyris Evans, currently considered as incertae sedis within the family, is transferred to Lancepyrinae mostly because it shares the same groundplan traits with Lancepyris.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Located over 3800 km from the nearest continent, the Hawaiian Islands have previously been thought to support only one endemic land mammal, the extant Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus), a taxon that apparently initially dispersed from mainland North America between 10,000 and 7000 years ago. Some uncertainty exists regarding the status of this taxon (i.e., whether or not populations representing more recent invasions of L. cinereus from North America are exchanging genes with the older lineage, and whether or not semotus represents a distinct species), but all researchers agree that hoary bats are the only endemic land mammals extant in the islands today. However, fossil evidence indicates that the Hawaiian Islands once supported another quite different endemic bat species that is now extinct. Skeletal remains of a new genus and species of vespertilionid bat are herein described from various Late Pleistocene and Holocene/Recent deposits on the five largest Hawaiian Islands. The new taxon is diagnosed by a mosaic of features including dental formula, molar morphology, skull shape, and metacarpal formula. This new taxon, which is smaller than Hawaiian hoary bat, was apparently present in the Hawaiian Islands by 320,000 years b.p. and survived until at least 1100 years ago and possibly much later. Accordingly, two species of bats coexisted on the Hawaiian Islands for several thousand years. As with numerous extinct endemic bird species, the extinction of the new bat taxon described here may have resulted either directly or indirectly from human colonization of the islands and the invasive nonnative species that came with human explorers and settlers.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'The Ruby Pipeline originates in Opal, Wyoming, travels westward across Utah and Nevada, and terminates in Malin, Oregon. Almost 360 miles of the line is in Nevada, where it crosses through some of the most remote, sparsely populated land in the lower 48 states. Despite the remote nature of this corridor, it has produced a rich archaeological record reflecting a dynamic history of land-use pattern changes over a period of at least 13,000 years. Archaeological excavations were conducted at 578 prehistoric sites prior to construction of the pipeline. The sites were distributed across four ecological regions, including (from west to east): the High Rock Country, Upper Lahontan Basin, Upper Humboldt Plains, and Thousand Springs Valley. First evidence of human occupation dates to the Paleoindian (14,500-12,800 cal b.p.) and Paleoarchaic (12,800-7800 cal b.p.) periods, when people spent most of their time in the High Rock Country where important economic resources reached their highest densities. Paleoindian findings are limited to a series of Great Basin Concave Base projectile points and small obsidian flaked stone concentrations. Paleoarchaic sites are much more common, and tend to be represented by Great Basin Stemmed projectile points, bifaces, and a limited number of other flaked stone tools. Most of these assemblages reflect small groups of hunters refurbishing their tool kits as they traveled through the area. An important exception to this pattern was found at Five Mile Flat along the west end of pluvial Lake Parman where two significant habitation sites dating to 11,180 cal b.p. were discovered. One of these sites includes a house floor, which is the oldest ever found in the Great Basin. Despite the warm-dry conditions that characterized much of the middle Holocene, it appears that human populations nearly doubled during the Post-Mazama Period (7800-5700 cal b.p.). Most activity remained concentrated in the High Rock Country, but evidence for occupation begins to trickle out into the Upper Lahontan Basin and Upper Humboldt Plains regions as well. Most of the artifact assemblages remain rather narrow, often composed of Northern Side-notched and Humboldt Concave Base points, bifaces, and debitage, and reflect use of the region by mobile groups of hunters. Major changes took place with the arrival of the Early Archaic (5700-3800 cal b.p.) and continued forward into the Middle Archaic Period (3800-1300 cal b.p.). Early Archaic projectile points are largely represented by Humboldt and Gatecliff forms. It appears that population densities increased almost fourfold from the preceding interval, and all four regions experienced significant occupation for the first time. Simultaneous to this population increase and dispersal, a full complement of site types began to emerge, with large-scale residential areas becoming significant for the first time. This trend continued forward into the Middle Archaic Period where the relative frequency of residential sites almost doubled compared with the Early Archaic interval. Plant macrofossil and archaeofaunal assemblages also become more abundant and diversified at this time, probably marking a broadening of the diet breadth. This general trajectory extends into the Late Archaic (1300-600 cal b.p.) and Terminal Prehistoric periods, as people continued to expand into a wider range of habitats. This was particularly case for the latter interval, as the habitat preferences that made sense for over 12,000 years were upended, with population densities highest in the Upper Humboldt Plains and Thousand Springs Valley. This reorientation corresponds to the arrival of Numic speaking populations, especially the Western Shoshone who appear to have reached northern Nevada much earlier than the Northern Paiute, and is probably linked to a greater emphasis on small-seeded plants that are abundantly present in their territory. Although low ranked compared to many other foods, with the proper technology and work organization, small seeds could support higher population densities than was the case earlier in time. Finally, the discovery of obsidian in multiple Terminal Prehistoric sites from sources located much further away than any other time in the past may signal the earliest use of horses in northern Nevada.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Tropidurus Wied, 1825, is one of the most ubiquitous lizard genera endemic to South America. Herpetologists from different regions of the continent have progressively mapped new populations, including undescribed species hidden under widely distributed nominal taxa. Currently, four monophyletic species groups are recognized in Tropidurus (T. bogerti group (monotypic), T. semitaeniatus group (four species), T. spinulosus group (five species), and T. torquatus group (16 species)), but none have been comprehensively revised taxonomically. During a collection expedition carried out in Paraguay in 2013, I recognized three new, distinct morphotypes among populations of the Tropidurus spinulosus group formerly assigned to T. guarani Alvarez et al., 1994. To delimit these new taxa, I analyzed coloration patterns, and quantified meristic and morphometric variables, comparing freshly collected samples with specimens housed in five museum collections. In this paper, I describe and illustrate the allopatric T. lagunablanca, n. sp., T. tarara, n. sp., and T. teyumirim, n. sp., and provide notes on their distribution limits, natural history, and conservation status.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Tropidurus Wied, 1825, is one of the most ubiquitous lizard genera distributed in open habitats of tropical and subtropical South America. Nevertheless, the broad representation of specimens of this group in scientific collections is hardly reflected in our knowledge of its taxonomic diversity. Most species currently assigned to Tropidurus began to be uncovered in the early 1980\\'s and additional populations in need of formal taxonomic treatment have been cataloged ever since. Herein, we name Tropidurus sertanejo, n. sp., a new species of the T. torquatus group endemic to the semiarid Brazilian Caatinga. Tropidurus sertanejo, n. sp., is currently known from two isolated populations in the municipalities of Caetit\\xe9 and Ibotirama, State of Bahia, Brazil. This is the only species of the T. torquatus group lacking granular mite pockets on the lateral neck, and it is also diagnosable by having a conspicuous bronze-colored head, a light-brown dorsal body with small pale salmon spots, and small body size in comparison with most congeners. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a paraphyletic Tropidurus, but firmly supported T. sertanejo, n. sp., as member of a monophyletic T. torquatus species group. Trees generated by independent analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data conflicted with our total evidence phylogenetic hypotheses. Since topological disagreements were detected among phylogenetic trees resulting from maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) reconstructions, and MP analyses do not require distinct evolutionary models or partition schemes to be defined prior to conduction of phylogenetic reconstruction, these factors were considered unlikely to explain all the variation in the observed results, favoring the interpretation of conflicting phylogenetic signal. Because detailed information on the distribution, population size, and ecological requirements of T. sertanejo, n. sp., are currently unavailable, we recommend the species to be listed as \"data deficient\" following the rules proposed by IUCN.',\n",

Details of nest size, location, depth, and structure are reported. Mature oocytes dissected from females are illustrated and described. Further information on its cocoon is presented and interpreted with respect to how it functions. The postdefecating larva is described and compared with that of S. o. obliqua (Say), the only other Svastra larva described to date. The association of this bee with Triepeolus penicilliferus (Brues) is further confirmed with the recovery of an immature larva of this cleptoparasite from one of the nest cells.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'Two clonal lineages, each comprising multiple generations of unisexual A. exsanguis, were produced in the laboratory from two lizards that were collected at the same locality in the field. Based on 10 meristic and four additional characters, we assessed morphological scores and relative variation as follows: (1) between the two laboratory lineages; (2) between these lineages pooled and samples of A. exsanguis and the bisexual (gonochoristic) A. inornata from the field; and (3) between field samples of the clonal lizards and A. inornata from a nearby locality. The two lineages differed significantly in the means and variances of two univariate characters and the two most informative multivariate characters. Contrary to expectations, the pooled sample of cloned laboratory lineages of A. exsanguis were as variable as the bisexual species in all 10 univariate characters and four important multivariate characters.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'A new species of smiliogastrin cyprinid is described from tributaries of the middle Congo River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Restriction of the genus name, Barbus, to certain large-bodied, (polyploid) barbins, and current uncertainty regarding phylogenetic relationships among the numerous small-bodied African (diploid) barbs, renders generic assignment for the new species problematical. Pending the results of ongoing systematic analyses, and to reduce short-term nomenclatural instability, the new species is described here as a species of \"Barbus.\" \"Barbus\" validus, new species, is readily distinguished from all other small-bodied African barbs by the combined possession of scales in midlateral series that are not enlarged relative to those along the impinging rows above and below; well-developed barbels, with the maxillary pair extending beyond the level of mideye, and the mandibular pair reaching the level of midopercle; the presence of numerous conical tubercles over the snout, cheek, and dorsum of head; a small circular occipital fontanel located medially at the parietal suture; well-developed gill rakers, with 8 or 9 on the hypo- and ceratobranchial elements of the first arch; a last unbranched dorsal-fin ray that is weakly ossified and lacking serrations along the posterior border; and a dorsal fin that is creamy white proximally and with the distal half to two thirds darkly pigmented.',\n",

       "  u'dc.description.abstract': u'These files supplement Ebel et al. (2016), a detailed exploration of the relative abundances, chemical compositions, and sizes of all types of chondrules, Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAI), amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOA) and matrix in CO and CV type carbonaceous chondrites. We use the collective term \\u201cinclusions\\u201d to describe all these components except matrix. These data include informational tables about the samples and mapping, x-ray emission element maps of Si, Mg, Ca, Al, Ti and Fe in each of the meteorite samples studied, derived data that allows image analysis of samples, and examples of software code used to perform image analysis. Element maps are 32-bit mosaics collected on the electron microprobe as described in the \\u201cMethods\\u201d section of Ebel et al. (2016). Maps \\u201c-xx.tif\\u201d are 8-bit masks that remove non-mapped portions of rectangular maps from consideration by software. Derived data based on outlining (segmentation) of inclusions includes maps \\u201c-GSclasts.tif\\u201d in which each type of inclusion has a different grayscale as per Tab-C of this supplement. Files \\u201c-IJdraw.tif\\u201d document the centers of mass of each segmented object, output from the ImageJ software (see reference in Ebel et al. 2016). Files \\u201c-IJresultsC.csv\\u201d (csv are comma-separated values in ASCII) tabulate the centers of mass (CofM) of each segmented object, output from the ImageJ software, and these CofM are manually corrected for CofM that fall in the matrix or mask, or in a nearby object.Files \\u201c-rgbTab.csv\\u201d list every inclusion, filtered for artifacts, with the Red-Green-Blue color combination of that inclusion in \\u201c-rgbClasts.tif\\u201d, and the minimum and maximum x and y of a bounding box around that inclusion. Other information includes the type of inclusion (originally assigned by inspection) and the computed area of each inclusion. With these data, it is possible to address rapidly and uniquely every pixel in any particular inclusion, and to then reference that pixel in all of the element maps. It is critical in this work that all the maps and derived mappings have identical x-y dimensions.\\r\\n\\tData are arrange in four directories (folders): BSE holds back-scattered electron maps of all samples for which BSE were collected, RGB holds red-green-blue composites in Mg-Ca-Al, and Si-Ca-Fe, CO holds all maps and derived data for CO chondrites, and CV holds the same for the CV chondrites.\\r\\n\\tFive tables are provided, with captions in the table files. Tab-A lists samples, Tab-B reproduces Ebel et al. (2016) Table 8, Tab-C lists grayscale color equivalences used for \\u201c-GSclasts.tif\\u201d, Tab-D through Tab-F itemize all inclusions (see also \\u201c-rgbTab.csv\\u201d files) and the total element counts in each pixel in each inclusion, for CO, Allende and non-Allene CV chondrite samples, respectively. These data, with appropriate averaging and manipulation, are the basis for most of the figures and tabulated data presented in Ebel et al. (2015). Note that mapping conditions  (dwell time and current) must be corrected among data sets to accurately compare element counts collected under different conditions.\\r\\n\\tA program written for IDL is provided, ClastCode-EbelEtal2015.pro (ASCII), that can be used to perform many of the image processing and analysis tasks described in the paper, using the digital data provided in this Extended Digital Supplement. This code is not guaranteed to work perfectly, however, it provides the basic algorithmic procedures used for much of the image analysis work reported.',\n",
